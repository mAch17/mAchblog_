My brother is confused which branch he should opt for between AI and computer science. As in upcoming times AI has a very large scope. Can anybody suggest me?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/pN2Q5y&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a branch called Artificial Intelligence already in some Indian college ? That is a bit too early. Some opinions from me :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion 1 : As of 2020, I personally feel that AI is not a field broad enough for a 4 year graduate course in Indian context, a BTech in Data Science in India is still conceivable. A Computer Science degree with Machine Learning, Deep Learning and good calculus and statistics courses should be enough to enter into the field of AI and I am almost sure this will not change in 4 years. Unless you are looking at an undergraduate research degree, I dont think a bachelor‚Äôs degree in AI will be worth it. In fact, a lot of the field of AI is just actually traditional Computer Science, Statistics and Optimization (All 3 fields were covered in my undergrad degree at BITS Pilani). The only new things are Deep/Machine Learning algorithms which can be taught in 2‚Äì3 electives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion 2 : Even if some university comes up with a clever course structure around BTech in AI say (I think there is a possible course structure choosing subjects from Computer Science and Maths and Machine Learning specific courses), I dont think any university in India has enough faculty talent pool to teach modern AI well apart from a few top ones. Its hard for large companies and top universities to find top AI talent, how would a general university afford it. Heck, most universities dont teach even Computer Science well. So many CS grads in India and many job vacancies never get filled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion 3: If you are really interested in AI, according to me a good path will be to pursue Computer Science from a college with good A. Coding campus culture and B. CS faculty in AI. Some good ones in India are : IIT(M/Kgp/B), IIITH, other good IITs, BITS and a few NITs. If you are not able to secure entry into these colleges try completing &lt;a href=&quot;http://deeplearning.ai/&quot;&gt;http://deeplearning.ai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;courses or do an online minor like &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/&quot;&gt;IIT Madras Online Degree Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just getting a degree in AI from a random institute where practical knowledge is rare will be of no use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendations from me here are are subjective, some people might not agree with what I say. Hope other people share their ideas with you as well so that you get a varied perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more general advice before you start your courses (not related to Machine Learning coursework) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people who join CSE willingly do so because they want to build a website, build a game, build a cool AI algorithm or build a software they always wondered about. Some join because they want to earn a lot ! A Computer Science degree teaches you not just how to build these things, but also the principles behind the building process. Remember you are getting in not just to learn what you always wanted to build, but also build it effectively in a technically sound way. Your aim should be to focus on both these goals : Learning to build using computers and learning the right way to build using Computers. They are slightly different skills, like cycling and learning about center of gravity and equilibrium in Physics, but the smartest people I find are those who know both how to write software and write it effectively. I will break it down more in upcoming points.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Studying to learn and studying for marks can be two different things sometimes and the same thing many other times. Learn to recognize this. Dont neglect your marks totally. A few days of studies before the exams manages grades well generally. However, more importantly, dont study just for exams. Remember if you dont come out of your university as a good (or an average) Data Scientist in your own perception, you would have wasted a lot of time and money even if you would have gotten good marks. On the other hand, if you come out as a good Data Scientist in just your perception with poor marks, the world will not be willing to bet on you. Lagom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember most teachers you will find on the way will be average or below average. Your aim should be to become better than most if not all of them. There would be many times when they will not be able to help you intuit about something well. Its your responsibility to use the vast amount of resources available to make yourself good at the courses you take. In computer science, you have this unique advantage of learning from anywhere. Don‚Äôt just depend upon your teachers for your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do practical things. Push yourself as much as possible to do practical projects with researchers/developers, even for no or little compensation or recognition. There are ways in Indian colleges to avoid practical work in courseware by doing ‚Äújugaad‚Äù. My biggest regret from my college days was not doing more practice. Again, do as many projects and as much programming as possible. In retrospective, the best way is to do jugaad in exams/labs so that you can score the maximum but do practice in your free time where you focus on quality and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember that credentials like marks and university brand value is just a good launchpad, your skills will take you ahead from there. Dont fret too much about marks if you think you are good at practice. Learn to build. Just don‚Äôt neglect exams and marks altogether as I said earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok. Enough of boring meta lecture. Let me tell more about academics :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn Python very well (and R too). They are easy and can be learnt online for free at many places. You need to be fluid in Python just like you are in one of the languages you speak. Programming is taught in most CSE curriculum but the aim is often to ensure a minimum standard than making you fluent at it. You need to take charge and make sure you are fluent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep a track of 3 courses being taught to you very well. These courses are Statistics, Linear Algebra and Optimization. As a Data Scientist, these are the three courses you use the most at job after programming. Many tutorials/courses available for free. Here is a list of 50+ free books which might be useful for self-learning these topics: &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;https://blog.paralleldots.com/data-science/50-must-read-free-books-for-every-data-science-enthusiast/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember your differentiator as a Computer Science first Data Scientist is going to be programming. Keep good command on Data Structures and Algorithms courses and Databases/Data Processing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you now about the basic somewhat, try doing courses like the ones listed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fast.ai/&quot;&gt;fast.ai ¬∑ Making neural nets uncool again&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;http://Deeplearning.ai/&quot;&gt;http://Deeplearning.ai&lt;/a&gt; and Data Analysis specializations on various platforms like Coursera/Edx. Please remember, doing the courses is more important, buying certificate is optional. Do assignments, not just theory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subscribe to a few newsletters to make sure what is going on in real world of Data Science when you are in college. State pf the art research and new tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally Answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-much-importance-do-good-colleges-IITs-all-play-in-forming-an-entrepreneur-and-how-does-it-differ-from-a-dropout-in-India/answer/Muktabh-Mayank&quot;&gt;https://www.quora.com/How-much-importance-do-good-colleges-IITs-all-play-in-forming-an-entrepreneur-and-how-does-it-differ-from-a-dropout-in-India/answer/Muktabh-Mayank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 things I consider very important to be a successful entrepreneur :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Intelligence :&lt;/strong&gt; ‚ÄúAll smart people don‚Äôt goto IITs/NITs‚Äù and ‚ÄúNot every IIT/NIT student is smart‚Äù, but you will agree that many of them have above average intelligence. Certain amount of intelligence is needed to be an entrepreneur and many good colleges will have kids like that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awareness/Environment/Compounding :&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most important, but really underrated property. Good colleges are a gathering of high percentage smart people who are connected to other smart people and know about what is going on in the world. The environment and conditioning in 4 years can change people‚Äôs world views a lot and make them look at world in a way that helps them churn out successful technology businesses. This is not unique to IITs say, Stanford, Cambridge &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts&quot;&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts ‚Äì Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and OxBridge etc have demonstrated this too. You can also see this in other spheres of life as many successful businessmen come out of successful business families and many brave army officers come out of army families and many civil servants come from civil servant families. Environment and conditioning compound over time and give a distinct advantage. I think this is the major contributions top colleges bring to ones life, awareness and network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Appetite :&lt;/strong&gt; Any successful entrepreneur is one who takes many risks. Risks which have extremely high payouts (in Billions of dollars) and relatively less loss (say 2 year in career growth). When one takes 10 such risks, they have probability of getting success is OK, when one takes 1 such risk, their probability of success is close to zero. Although it might sound unfair, but it is about trying to get lucky while losing out less for every trial. IITians and people from top college know that the payout on success is huge, while on failing their degree/credential will give them some kind of a social security by getting them a decent job. For someone without a credential, its just way harder making their risk appetite less. Introduce some kind of achievement based social security for entrepreneurs and see the number of startups from non-elite colleges soar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cannot say about dropouts, you don‚Äôt have too many dropouts in India ! Peter Thiel asks people to dropout and work on their business and when you look at his fellows, that doesn‚Äôt look entirely wrong. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship&quot;&gt;Thiel Fellowship - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, society in India recognizes credentials much more (probably because we were rules by British in past) and the factor 2 above will not be fully possible for a dropout. That said, one can build awareness and network without going to a top college too, its not impossible, they just need to know what to do and stay committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As bad it feels while saying this, CSE is actually NOT overrated in India. CS has both a supply side and demand side advantage in India thus creating opportunities that are just not possible for other streams. Let me try to explain my point :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most (not all) Indian educational institutes were opened after India allowed foreign firms to enter India. These firms were either opening sweatshops in India or opened factories in India so that they could sell to Indian market. As you can imagine, not a lot of innovation is required for both such jobs as all they need is cheap resources and people managers with domain knowledge. This shaped the Indian education system to create Engineering Schools which handed out degrees to average engineers for cheap. Government, Businessmen and People they all wanted cheap accessible degrees, why spend a lot on Engineering education when everyone gets a 2.4‚Äì3 Lakh Rupees per year job, wherever they study from. One wont spend 50 Lakhs to get a degree that pays 3 Lakhs/Year. To be clear, I am not complaining, this was a good move given pre-1990 salaries in country. People did not mind doing low quality work if it paid relatively better. Only some T-schools subsidized by government could continued focusing on high quality during this time. Students from these institutes had to run to US or EU for a job as they just couldn‚Äôt compete salarywise to others. Most Indian colleges have BAD faculty, not even average. We have better high school teachers in our nation than Engineering lecturers in many cases, because to push cheap degrees, we cannot pay good money to people teaching engineering. When all you need is an Engineering degree to get a low wage job with high certainty, this is what would emerge. Unlike other branches of engineering, where you need great investment to setup labs and research facilities, CSE education can effectively be completed on a single laptop. Most universities and experts around the world are also more open in CSE to share their knowldge through the internet, very less secret and proprietary research. High quality CSE study material is available for free or cheap on internet for minimal investment and someone who doesn‚Äôt want to be just an average Engineer and wants to actually know and build in detail has an option to do so. People in colleges with good infrastructure (IITs/BITS) could take advantage of this arbitrage before it was commonplace. Almost everyone in our batch (2008‚Äì12) had done Ars Digita University &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArsDigita_University&quot;&gt;ArsDigita University ‚Äì Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; courses during our engineering years. So unlike no other branches of Engineering, in CSE, people can spend quite less money to get a degree and still become very good Engineers if they know where to find the right information. You have coursera, edx, udacity, udemy and many free courses on youtube teaching CSE for free/cheap. This is a unique advantage for CSE students. While you still get a degree from a system that is designed to make you average, but still, you can be really good. This creates an arbitrage where your salary requirement would be lesser than the top engineers who invest a lot of money for quality education. Supply of high quality cheap Engineers brought in many many jobs opportunities into India. Unlike the sweatshop work of yonder years, this was well paying work. If there is a reason why CSE is so coveted, it is this set of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This created a cycle, India‚Äôs top software talent then went ahead founding more software based companies/startups whose high caliber, high skill work in done in India as well. This created more high paying positions and talented individuals which forced more foreign firms to bring high caliber more jobs into India to stay competitive. A self-enforcing cycle. Basically, Indian software power is like a black hole, keeps sucking in jobs and thus creating better outcomes for students. In last 10‚Äì15 years, the entire scenario has changed for the better in a way no one could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most other industries in India mostly took safe bets. Put up a car assembly line, Build a road and things like that. Indian Engineering jobs in these sectors have been domain-informed people-management mostly. All innovation was mostly done in US or Germany or (now) China. There was no loop of Skill-Jobs supply-demand set up. Reason being there is no way to get cheap education in say Mechanical Engineering or Electrical Engineering without compromising in quality to self-motivated people. With India now moving towards a self fulfilling manufacturing base, we will probably start moving towards this, but the progress will be slower.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question, CSE is actually a good bet for people who have no idea about what they are interested in. Most kids actually dont know what they will want to do at the age of 17‚Äì18 years as our education system before that keeps us away from decision-making and vocation. Maybe that would improve in the future too. For such people, it is actually a good bet to take CSE. If they put in some effort apart from what is taught in the class, their learning has no restrictions and they might make it big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for someone who understands how they will chart a course as a Mechanical Engineer say, it is stupid to push them into pursuing CSE. One of my first year wingmates took Mechanical Engineering at BITS by choice (ie could have gotten a Information Systems degree like me which had a lower cutoff or even Electronics as he had scored high) knew exactly what he wanted to do in Mechanical Engineering and ended up creating one of the biggest robotics companies India had ever seen. Smart people will almost always find their way !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatives are pushing you to get a degree than do self study due to three things :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming from our British colonial past and then post-independence socialism and then IT services based economy, credentials of a person (like degrees, certificates) have been used as a filter have been used to filter people for jobs (marriages too in some parts of India from what I hear, ‚Äúcannot marry my kid unless you are an IITian‚Äù). So when your relatives were students, a good degree was must to get anywhere. Indians were mostly doing petty stuff for most of this time, aircraft maintenance than aircraft building, updating BI tools rather than creating BI tools and implementing an MNC‚Äôs policy in India rather than making policies. The problem with such relatively-lower-skill jobs is you just need ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù people for them and thus can use any arbitrary filters to screen them. Degrees, thus were very important to tell how ‚Äúeligible‚Äù one is. When I was writing JEE and BITSAT in 2007‚Äì08, not getting into a good college basically meant very very reduced exposure and brownie points, there was no match between the outcomes of an elite degree and non-elite one! Even now, there is still some difference in outcome, if a person has no differentiator other than college degree. This has started changing only very recently as Indians have started building original products and companies, which is harder to achieve and thus they need people who are really good and passionate about their work. Hiring someone from IIT who cannot get my app grow really fast by digital marketing is not going to help me as a founder, I would rather hire someone who is really good at digital marketing from whatever college. Due to the competition, Indian elite colleges are still much more likely to produce many super-intelligent and hardworking people than average colleges, but yeah, IIT/BITSians only type job postings are slowly declining. So by this criterion, I guess there is no disadvantage in not wasting money on a university degree. At least for programming and Computer Science, free and high-quality education is available online which you can get to become a great programmer without any CS degree. If you are going to start a company or going to work for startups for most of your time and are committed to keeping your skills top notch by self learning, graduation degree actually is redundant. But be assured that institutions that run on credentials: Banks, Service companies, formal education, government and others, are almost never going to hire you, unless there is a radical change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, the field of academia is still very credential based. It is not uncommon to hear someone to get rejected from a MS(Data Science) program because their Bachelors was in Electronics. Think of it, there should be no big deal about an electronics graduate willing to pursue Data Science, but academia as a field runs by credentials and sometimes even this gets stuck. No wonder, academia is the system of credential building and the whole castle will fall if they start making exceptions. So if you are avoiding graduation, you can be assured that you cannot go back to a college or university at skill level you really are at after all the self learning. You will have to start with bachelors whenever you decide to go back to school, even if you might have published a paper in Nature. Chris Olah, who is an AI researcher at OpenAI (and flunked graduation when he heard and read Peter Thiel) writes in detail about it here : &lt;a href=&quot;https://colah.github.io/posts/2020-05-University/&quot;&gt;Do I Need to Go to University?&lt;/a&gt; He used to be active on Quora too !&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One important thing you need to know about universities, they may be suboptimal institutions at undergraduate level, but they are really good at one thing, ensuring a minimum standard when a student is given a degree. Everyone getting a degree is not really great at their job, but you know that they will have some bare essential qualification if they have taken exams and completed formalities. If you decide to stay outside this framework and take responsibility and are driven to self-educate overcoming procrastination and comfort-zone, it is really good. However, you have no safety net, there is no guarantee that you are not totally wasting your time away. You will have to be very proactive to make sure you are actually making progress and are not getting stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net net, ditching gradation was unthinkable maybe even 5 years back, but for programmers, it is a feasible decision now. However, it has many implications which one needs to understand before they take the call. Its a ‚Äúpackage deal‚Äù all the independence and super efficient learning combined with the risk of procrastination, staying no to credential based system. Make your choice well, Hope this helps !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don‚Äôt know how the job market will look after 4 years (understanding that you are entering Engineering now). From what we have seen in history, after a economic crisis (like the ongoing year where jobs are extremely hard to come by), there is a economic boom. Unless the policy is really bad (or socialist which doesn‚Äôt allow private sector), an economic slump weeds out bad (sometime good) competitors and when the market gets some confidence back, the survivors experience a massive surge. Also people who lose jobs develop new expertise and come back with new innovative ideas in the booming market where the survivors are making money to make more money themselves. During an economic crisis is the best time to get educated and prepare for a future career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, during my early years at BITS, the 2008‚Äì09 crisis had made things really bad. My seniors had to take jobs with companies who were not allowed in campus a few years back because they paid really less or had employment terms not aligned with college‚Äôs policy. But that was a bad time to enter workforce. However, by the time I graduated in 2012, the job market was in full swing and people were getting placed in top MNCs with salaries 2008-09 graduates could only dream of. The MNC craze got done around 2015‚Äì16 with Indian startups becoming the highest payers until this pandemic disruption. The pandemic disruption will change industry and economy for long term, but unless something goes really wrong, I think 2‚Äì3 years down the road, we should experience another economic boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people dont think in terms of RoI and treat education as a cost to build long term employment out of it. So take a loan, complete a degree, work your way up the ladder, pay the loan back, do a masters, start a family‚Ä¶ you know the general rule. If you are planning this type of a trajectory, I think its a good bet to get into college and start a degree right now and hope economy to bounce back in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a quick RoI on the 25 Lakhs, well that is a lot of money to get time bound RoI on. During our batch, you could typically earn back all money you spent on college degree in a year or two. Even lesser if you had an MCN. However, it seems that wont be the case now. In a positive way, that can be a good incentive for people to work really hard and develop as much expertise as possible during their stay in college, because that degree is really you burning a lot of money. People 10 years back had optionality, people now dont have that, great things are achieved when you dont have optionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also probably incoming college students need to think more about long term perspective before they choose what they study. For example, A lot of my batchmates just took a loan for a US college degree just after they passed out and had to think of the RoI only while planning for their masters degrees, I dont think new people will have that liberty given 25 Lakh already needs borrowing money at graduate level. At least one or two paths to follow after they graduate should be clear to them from start. You can only get a sure-shot high RoI if you plan a way to get RoI, dont just invest and hope the dice turns a SIX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be expecting a bit too much maturity out of the young people entering colleges and I am sorry about that. We are not expected to make any decisions in our first 12‚Äì14 years of education and it will be huge change to take a decision keeping 4 years in perspective. That you are asking a question about RoI at such a young age is already impressive. Hope you have a good BITSAT score :) .&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Collecting my answers from Quora, where I advice young students getting into engineering now and aspiring to build a career in Data Science, AI or Programming.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Startups During Pandemic Disruption</title><link href="https://muktabh.xyz/2020/09/12/Startups-During-Pandemic-Disruption.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Startups During Pandemic Disruption" /><published>2020-09-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-09-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://muktabh.xyz/2020/09/12/Startups-During-Pandemic-Disruption</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://muktabh.xyz/2020/09/12/Startups-During-Pandemic-Disruption.html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-what-is-the-effect-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-ai-based-startups&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúWhat is the effect of the covid-19 pandemic on AI-based startups?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of startups using AI IMO :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AI first startups : Companies that are selling an AI algorithm or outputs of an AI algorithm as its product. My startup &lt;a href=&quot;http://paralleldots.com/&quot;&gt;Image Recognition to Optimize Retail Execution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- end list --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;belongs to this category. There can be variety of startups in this category trying to sell chatbots, automated surveillance, voice recognition systems, fancy apps that change face photos into old/young or morph them, heck even startups which provide AI tools to ensure compliance during COVID19-prevention which fall in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AI augmented companies : Companies that use AI to enhance an already existing products they have or trying to integrate AI into their product. Typical examples would be an email service providing company trying to use AI to assist writing, a manufacturing company trying to deploy smarter robots in their factories, CRM trying to rate prospective leads and an e-commerce company showing recommendations to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might be easily able to guess, there will many more companies of type 2, as most organizations have some or the other problem statements they would like to address using AI algorithms. Basically every company in the world whose core product is not an AI algorithm falls in 2. These companies account for most AI related jobs as A. They are relatively larger companies than most AI first companies, most AI first companies are smaller startups as of today and 2. There are just too many AI augmented companies as compared to AI first companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This differentiation was necessary as COVID19 disruption needs to thought of in different ways for 1 and 2. You cannot merge them both into a single set of predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI first companies :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are looking at AI first companies, their trajectory during COVID19 is dependent upon what customers are they serving and what problems are they solving. Different companies saw different outcomes. The following characteristics provided worst-to-best outcomes for companies :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Companies which were serving industries which depended upon people moving out of their homes will have had very severe outcomes. These are companies which provided AI solutions to travel sector, malls, hotels, airlines, offices etc. Money in such verticals is almost non-existant for time being and will be for sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are industries which despite being hit with COVID-19 cannot close down as they are essential industries. These are retail, healthcare, government services, telecom, banking etc. AI startups these industries saw steep revenue declines during lockdown period as everyone was really afraid at that time and was observing how will the future look, however, with markets reopening, the revenues are slowly becoming stabilized and coming back to normal. New pilots have started rolling out too. Such companies are taking precautions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Both of the above points were for B2B AI startups. B2C startups, if they had any chance of becoming successful, would have had a great time during COVID-disruption as people were locked down at homes and had lot of free time to spend on their phones. Many face swap videos and lipsync videos made using AI went viral on the internet during the disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It has been a really great time for startups that help institutions monitor COVID19-prevention compliance or help companies and organizations maintain social distancing or help them move their operations online during COVID19 as their services became ‚Äúpain pills‚Äù. A few startups with bad outcomes in 1 (or maybe 2), launched new AI products of this category. This involves some kinds of chatbots, face mask monitors and AI+robotics applications reducing/removing human contact. Ecommerce and delivery AI startups should be having a great day as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net-Net, some companies gained, other companies lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI augmented companies :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is very different here. Please remember that while for some companies like OTT, e-commerce etc., AI has shown clear cut value; most companies in this category are running AI Proof-of-Concepts and Product Development in hope that one day they should be able to get lead over their competitors using their AI edge. So most AI operations in such companies (startups or even larger) are discretionary/R\&amp;amp;D expenses. Most startups during COVID19 disruption have cut discretionary expenses to prolong their runway. Same would be the case with larger companies too. This have brought expansion in AI activities and hiring in such companies to a standstill. Hence, you would see tweets like this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it‚Äôs clear that for many smaller companies that invested in deep learning, it turned out not to be essential and got cut post-Covid as part of downsizings. There are somewhat fewer people doing deep learning now than half a year ago, for the first time since at least 2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech companies serve either other companies (B2B) or consumers (B2C). When an uncertain situation comes up, any customer (be it companies or consumers) will tighten the strings of their purse as its hard to predict the future. When less money is in circulation, you see GDP falling and companies, businesses and even government making lesser money. Companies who are already alert will react to sudden revenue decline even more proactively, cutting off discretionary expenses like say R\&amp;amp;D or new projects or HR redundancy. That gets many projects defunded, wages cut and you see even lesser money being spent. Basically a vicious cycle of economic bust. It exactly opposite of what happens in economic growth. Its hard to visualize this, but a lot of economy is just people believing that a company, country or economic system is ‚Äúworth putting in money‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think big company / small company dichotomy can be used to explain which tech company did bad or well during pandemic disruption. A company‚Äôs performance during/after pandemic IMO will be dependent upon a combination of :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. how hedged company is against risk,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. how much does pandemic effect the customer base of the company and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. whether the pandemic creates new opportunity for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a very detailed analysis in terms of AI startups here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pNC3bb&quot;&gt;Muktabh Mayank‚Äôs answer to What is the effect of the covid-19 pandemic on AI-based startups?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of three factors A,B and C above make sure that you have super success stories in startups (new decacorns like Fastly or Zoom were born) where on the other hand many startups shut shop or cut their team massively. Startups whose consumer base did not get effected or ones who were hedged with large runway actually many a times used the pandemic as an opportunity. Because startups differ at A,B and C, you see varied results like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital Transformation Reality Check: Not all SaaS companies have benefited from Covid! In fact, I‚Äôd argue only 3 (Zoom, Shopify, Fastly) have truly benefited. With Q2 earnings mostly under wraps, we can look at the absolute change in growth rates from Q2 - Q1 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uYVKpxd3Pi&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uYVKpxd3Pi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large companies are generally supposed to be more fragile and strong to take advantage of opportunities that arise due to a disruption like the pandemic, but many of them were busy buying back there shares instead of hedging themselves and they now have to beg for shareholders to bail them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-is-wfh-a-bonus-for-tech-firms&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúIs WFH a bonus for tech firms?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe, but we don‚Äôt know that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large scale WFH has never been tried before. The tech industry had two alternatives, large scale Work From Home (WFH) or shut down work temporarily. 100s of people sit in a common workplace with air conditioning and it was extremely risky to continue in office work. Between two options work from home was better without doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether WFH is better than regular office is still not clear. Companies save money by not paying office maintenance or sometimes office rents altogether. So assuming nothing else changes, the companies should be at a gain. But, things are not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from home has created new challenges, like say, time sync and even simple things are relatively hard to communicate. While people who have more visibility have equal productivity, freshers find it harder to work remotely. We still dont know if the penalty due to these challenges is lesser than the office expense saving or no. But we know that the penalties should get better with time as people slowly overcome their inhibitions over working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you mean by India‚Äôs Silicon Valley ? Do you mean Indian startups ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I personally think we haven‚Äôt had any success as a Silicon Valley alternative. We dont develop nearly enough good technology products yet. We have huge operations based startups like E-Commerce, e-Grocers, e-Milkmen, e-classes(edutech) and e-XYZs. These according to me dont qualify as Silicon Valley ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù. Only successes we have had with pure tech play in past are Chennai SaaS heavyweights like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zoho.com/&quot;&gt;Zoho - Cloud Software Suite and SaaS Applications for Businesses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freshworks.com/&quot;&gt;A fresh approach to customer engagement&lt;/a&gt; . That said, we are slowly beginning to see Indian success in High end Technology startups like say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greyorange.com/&quot;&gt;Home - GreyOrange&lt;/a&gt; , [Hasura&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Instant GraphQL APIs for your data&lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;td&gt;The Collaboration Platform for API Development](https://www.postman.com/) . One year of bad economics is not going to change or reverse the trend. Postman infact became a unicorn (valued at US$ 2B) during the COVID pandemic. [Postman‚Äôs valuation soars to $2B with latest round&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok. But I think to most Indians, Silicon Valley success in India generally means the Flipkarts and other operations startups which deliver your milk or groceries or cellphones or teaches math to your kids or helps you sell your old and new stuff. Luckily, these startups are growing better than expected. In fact, they are growing at the cost of regular Indian businesses due to the lockdowns, fears in going out and quarantines. You can read 100s of articles about the Antifragile Indian startup ecosystem published in last few days&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;{I am trying to strip it down to very basic answer, it might actually lose some depth here in the way to make the big picture clear. Do understand that there are many many more details into play and all businesses are unique. }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this, you need to understand how these high growth startups work as opposed to large companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Large established companies have had a lot of time to settle in the market, optimize their practices to better their bottomline and thus optimize profits. That is once an established company/business is sure it has reached the peak market share (equilibrium between customer acquisition / attrition ), it would then try to optimize expenses, thus maximize profits and invest some parts of profits into innovations to launch new products. So in time of crisis, its a pretty simple process for the established businesses, they will cut down discretionary expenses and focus on their optimized profit making core. So they will cut jobs for products that make less profit, but the employees who work on their power products, continue to work and thrive. It is wrong to just blame all layoffs on startups, established companies have done layoffs too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/britains-rolls-royce-to-cut-9000-jobs-amid-air-travel-slump/articleshow/75842204.cms&quot;&gt;Britain‚Äôs Rolls-Royce to cut 9,000 jobs amid air travel slump - The Economic Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- end list --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;High growth startups are however a very different type of business. The point is to achieve the worth and scale of a well established company in a few years or a decade (Something that an established company would have achieved in many decades or in over a century even). For example, Tesla is now worth more than any other automobile company in the world, worth even more than Volkswagen, GM, Ford, companies around 100 years old. Amazon is worth more than any other retail chain, in fact many other retail chains combined. Airbnb is larger than many huge hotel chains. Uber is larger than any other taxi rental. How did these companies achieve in a few years that larger businesses took decades to do or probably could never even achieve ? Because they work in a different way. They invest in topline to achieve economies of scale / network effect, after which their unit economics is supposed to suddenly click. Lets try to break down the statement I made just before this, what is Unit Economics ? that is profit in every transaction. So for example, I make an Electric Vehicle for cost X, I will have to sell it for Y (Y &amp;gt; X) to achieve a profit. The more the value of Y-X is, more is the profit per vehicle, Unit Economics means Y-X &amp;gt; 0. High growth startups/companies will not wait to optimize bottomline to make Y-X &amp;gt; 0 to launch their product, they will start with maybe X &amp;gt; Y and pump money to scale. The entire plan is that at scale, the cost X goes down automatically, so beyond a certain point of market growth, the company should automatically achieve unit economics. This is driven by economies of scale and/or network effect, both of which are very well known phenomena in Economics. So the large sums of money these startups raise are used to pump more and more money to achieve growth to reach unit economics. So when a startup raises money A, it gets a target, to reach C customers by date D. An example would be startup raising in Feb 2020, 1 million dollars to reach 50000 Monthly Active Users by Feb 2021 raised by a company. The startup plans to pump almost 8000 dollars per month to achieve the numbers. What happens when pandemic disruption hits and startup does nothing? the startup will not be able to customers at nearly the rate they expected while they will continue burning money at the rate expected. Thus, the next round of funding will not be possible as the investor will only put money at 50000-ish MAUs. A sure shot path to the startup doing nothing shutting down in future. So, these companies acknowledge that they will be not able to show the growth, and will hence cut costs, such that whenever the circumstances become OK, they can come back to their old trajectory. They will still achieve lesser than what they were expecting in the start with the amount of money they have (because they are bleeding all that extra money during COVID19 despite a reduced burn rate and little growth), but at least the startups will survive to show growth. Cutting costs involves reducing salaries, layoffs, closing offices .. so on..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Doesn‚Äôt know much about business except ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs build some cool tech that will sell itself‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Outsider to the startup world. (That is you don‚Äôt know people who have done startups closely so as to take lessons from their life).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. India based. Indians are quite different from the rest of the world culturally and there are things Indians observe/miss that others don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. You are not a super-exceptional team, that is not already famous before you started your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will link definitions of startup linked terms in case you are such a beginner as described and aren‚Äôt aware of a few such terms. I did not know many startup-y terms when I started my company, I dont understand a few even yet maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, even if you are more evolved/different than this startup-wise, you might still appreciate some points of the post, but you will find that other portions state the obvious. That is power of hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;big-picture-of-doing-a-startup--for-beginners&quot;&gt;Big picture of doing a startup ‚Äì For Beginners&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs start with the basics first. Why did you get into a startup ? What are you really required to do when you are running a startup ? While for repeat entrepreneurs and people who come from a professional/social network of entrepreneurs would be very clear about this, an outsider is not. A 2014 version of me would probably not be very clear about some things here. If you read lot of startup literature, this might be a boring section for you as most stuff here is talked about a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-start-up-&quot;&gt;Why start up ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a startup because I wanted to work on tech that I found cool and also I wanted to be my own boss. That was the aim at least in the start. I think startup is an actually good place to get into if you have same aims as me. But as cliched as it may sound ‚Äúwith great power comes great responsibility‚Äù. Unlike in a day to day job, in startup you are taking up a lot of risk too. I cannot understate it here, if you dont make something good out of yourself in your startup, you will actually suffer loss and so will your near and dear ones and your early employees who trust you with their future. It takes sometime after you are in a startup to realize whether you were investing time and resources correctly or not. While there is a relived content type of feeling after seeing you have done relatively better for your people and your early employees, it also will be quite anxious a feeling otherwise. I will repeat it again, in early days of a startup, rewards are so sparse it is easy to confuse between a time period between rewards and pure inaction leading nowhere. You need to stay focused and stick to fundamentals during such confusing times, otherwise you might find that you have wasted time quite late. People generally try to understate the risk, getting secluded from social life, psychological hardships and stress, financial troubles and opportunity cost of people trying to enter the startup world as total noobs so that they don‚Äôt get discouraged. I don‚Äôt think you should think of the risk you are taking as soft, it exists and you need to be aware of it so that you don‚Äôt lose sight of your goal and lax out. It will be quite easy to lax out on the startup journey and you need to hammer it deep in your head that you cannot afford such a thing. That said, the upsides are great. I can ascertain that total absolute freedom to work in your style, taking decisions that actually change outcomes along the way and seeing your concepts change the world is a feeling that all the risk is worth it for. This feeling of achievement cannot be overstated. I assume when the financial gains reach you, it would be great too. (I‚Äôm not really rich yet so cannot comment how does that feel).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are privileged people who do startups too. They can maintain good social life, life relatively comfortably even while doing a startup and will be shown in media as cool startup people. Don‚Äôt buy into the hype. Privileged people have more risk appetite and they can afford more failures and they can thus have many trials and need to get successful just at one. Probably that‚Äôs where the privileged founder narrative in the media comes from, more risk appetite is associated with better success, just due to the sheer number of trials and learning. For a lower middle class/middle class person (sp. If you are Indian), one failed startup is probably the maximum number of attempts they will get in this space, they need to make it count. Remember: ‚ÄúMake it count‚Äù. If you have a gut feeling not enough is happening, you are probably right, take charge and push and ‚ÄúMake it count‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this section was more emotional than I intended to. Let‚Äôs try to come to more important business henceforth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-startup-&quot;&gt;What is a startup ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a AI startup ? If you are building an AI startup, you need to :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Build a fast growing product business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Fast growing means you can show metrics on which you are getting better faster YoY or quarter on quarter. These metrics are kind of fixed : Number of paying customers and revenue in B2B businesses and number of active users in consumer businesses. Unless you are really famous already due to some reason (or rich in which case you fund your own adventures), odds are VC wont fund your technology, papers, patents or github stars. In India, the famous people are ex-FAANG people, people from Indian unicorns, serial entrepreneurs, Stanford (or Ivy League) educated etc. They will find it slightly easy to find really good money for doing lesser than non-famous people. At seed funding level, being educated at India‚Äôs top T-Schools like IITs and BITS Pilani (I studied there) has some advantages. VCs will (unless you are special) either fund your startup if you have a product doing well, or a product showing growth and they can see potential in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Product business means you are selling the same concept to all your customers. I mean you cannot sell soap to one person and toothpaste to another and matchsticks to a third person. The reason is, unless you have a product, you wont be able to grow fast as stated earlier. More so in AI as building proper sellable AI products takes time (I will talk about it a lot later in this post) and there is no way you can grow fast if you need to invest time to build for every client. This might sound obvious advice to people from elsewhere, but freshers doing AI startups would often feel they can do everything in the world and need to be aware about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Try to focus on your core business and avoid distractions. There will be many. If you have a good AI team, as of now the field is still nascent enough for your team to basically build into anything possible by AI. So every possible Deep Learning enabled business might sound like a missed opportunity to someone good at training algorithms. What AI founders need to realize is that PoC is just the first step and substantial investment post that is needed to build a product. Developing AI for a PoC is simple, building one which runs in production is not. Unless they FOCUS, they will not be able to build a product and hence not be able to show growth which they require to get funded and grow their business further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Let me emphasize that I think there is a very good opportunity to build AI services business too. You can solve different problems for different clients and rent out your great AI workforce. But that is not something that is being covered on this post. I am trying to highlight tricks to build a AI product startup which can possibly be accelerated by VC funding. A very different approach needs to be taken there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story of all startups are different and one cannot copy playbook of one into another blindly. Different startups raise seed funding at different times, accordingly will have PoCs at different levels at time of seed funding, will evolve and pivot differently and thus will grow and raise money with different trajectories. I could recount the story of my startup here, but it would be at a different time, under different circumstances than other startups and hence to learn from story directly would either be an oversimplification or hard to relate. So I will list down things I think are invariants, will be needed in all AI startups without thinking about their path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you think you are really famous and can attract many rounds of funding just by your CV, I again urge you to stick to the fundamentals as much as possible. ‚ÄúFast Growing‚Äù ‚ÄúProduct‚Äù is what you need to build, stick to it and dont deviate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;b2b-businesses&quot;&gt;B2B businesses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise businesses are basically B2B. Good classification of B2B businesses can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2014/10/five-ways-to-build-100-million-business.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2014/10/five-ways-to-build-100-million-business.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . An AI-for-enterprise startup is more on the elephant hunting side if we think according to the blog. That basically means, you have relatively fewer customers with large $ value. On the other hand, there can also be a B2B business that sells to many many customers but charges less $ per customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A utopia is a business like Slack (or Zoom) where you have growth like B2C business but you can charge companies as a B2B product. These B2B businesses become huge fast due to fast adoption at consumer level and then revenues follow as businesses pay. If you have an idea of a product which starts life as consumer and then makes employers pay, you can make it big real fast. That said, other business ideas need to be driven through inside/outside sales and marketing and dont rely on consumer based growth and network effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the nature of it, a low $ product needs to be a simple one and a high $ product needs to be complex. If product is cheap, you cannot really have customer satisfaction teams and customer support. That means, you have to make a simple-to-use product UX wise and utility wise. The customer will have to adapt themselves to use the product and how well your UX helps them adapt determines the win in low cost high volume B2B products. OTOH, someone paying a high $ for the product will not be open to change their practices and will instead expect the product to cater to their way of doing things. That means AI-for-enterprise products will try to solve broad problems, will have to integrate with many other software, will need to provide some customer support and will need to adapt to customers. The take away is that enterprise products are more complex so as they can subsume different idiosyncrasies of large companies buying them, low cost B2B product need to be simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ai-b2b-startups&quot;&gt;AI B2B startups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By AI B2B startups (I also use the term AI first startups to describe such companies) I mean startups which are selling AI tool or its output directly to their customers. I dont count startups here who have an already selling product and they are augmenting their main product‚Äôs capability using AI. For an AI first startup , the USP is their AI capabilities while for a company enhancing their product using AI, their USP is their pre-existing product. These are different beasts. A company for whom the product sells an AI algorithm or its output will need to develop very different capabilities. Apart from figuring out the regular stuff like Product Market Fit, Pricing, Product Development and Sales, they will also have to figure out building a good dataset to train AI on, getting good AI talent and creating/deploying AI algorithms that actually work. Essentially AI startups are like other SaaS companies but also have traits that are unaddressed by SaaS playbook. I will hopefully address some of these issues you face in the post as we go ahead. Some of the concepts I introduce will apply to other DeepTech startups too where you have to develop your own technology before you can sell it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are beginner thinking of starting a AI first company, stop and course correct if you tick more than 2-3 boxes below. If you have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Low expertise in business domain where you want to sell AI in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Low expertise in building Deep Learning/Machine Learning systems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Cannot raise a LOT OF seed money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. Don‚Äôt have decent Data Ops/Analytics/tech capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E. Haven‚Äôt figured out AI USP of your product at your university (or if you are brilliant during your self study).&lt;/strong&gt; Basically a lot of research work needs to be done by your team after starting the company. You dont tick E and you dont have to tick B automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can maybe make it work if you click over 3 boxes, but it will be hard !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We as a startup ticked A and E. We sorted out E somewhat by floating our own R\&amp;amp;D team and doing original research to build the good proprietary technology available and A by hiring business experts from within the domain we are selling the product in. However, that required funding $$$, setting up annotation capability to collect datasets and doing timebound R\&amp;amp;D to create algorithms which work. If there was one more point missing for us maybe, it would have been way harder to make it even to the first sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low &lt;em&gt;expertise in business domain&lt;/em&gt; is sort of guaranteed for a first time founder in their 20s/30s as you need to stay longer in industry to know it inside-out. Not saying no young founder can have the knowhow, but probability is small. One good way to sort out this point in early days of a startup is to have an equity compensated senior mentor or an experienced co-founder in the team. As the company grows, and your ESOPs get more repute, you can use them to hire domain experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low &lt;em&gt;expertise in building Deep Learning systems&lt;/em&gt; within founding team is another obstacle. Even if you understand the use-case well, you need one responsible person to make things happen. There are many people who claim they can create working AI systems, few who can even do it and most of these people don‚Äôt come cheap. The best is to have this person in founding team, the other alternative is bring in a well paid person (cash + equity) to get stuff done. This person should be responsible to figure out how the AI will work, how the technology and IP will be developed so that you stay abreast or ahead of the competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its bad to not to be able to raise a lot of money initially&lt;/em&gt;. Raising good money is excellent at any stage of the company (of course not diluting yourself like crazy) a good guide here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saastr.com/benchmarks-in-saas-for-seed-and-series-a-rounds/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://www.saastr.com/benchmarks-in-saas-for-seed-and-series-a-rounds/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (In India, somewhat lower ticket sizes given low cost of running business). However, at seed stage, you probably will need to raise more for a AI company than a traditional SaaS business. Its good if your investor offers you a ‚Äúnice‚Äù valuation for being an AI startup, or you will have to dilute extra equity if you are being judged as a typical SaaS (So its better for you to find an angel who is open to understanding how AI works than someone who purely invests on business metrics at seed stage). This extra money will be used to take care of many extra investments an AI startup needs. These are : A. Building Datasets to make your AI outputs better. B. Creating an AI team (and the cost of infrastructure required by it) which will create algorithms better than the ones available in public domain. This is your IP and USP which differentiates your company from another founder who decides to start a competitor with same or higher seed funding. TL,DR : Investments in AI are higher than SaaS to make revenue. I am not the only one that thinks so : &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Ops/Tech/Analytics capability&lt;/em&gt; is needed in a AI first startup just like any other SaaS. So its not just an AI team you need to solve everything. Right from day 1, you need to setup ops team to annotate data for your AI to train on. You also need to build product just like any other typical software product and have dashboards which show the client the needed information. In my estimate, there is an equivalent amount or even more of Data Engineering required as compared to the AI training to make AI work for a client. Very detailed analysis and conversation needs to happen when Data + Ops + Tech + Analytics + AI pipelines are being setup as these workflows will be repeated 100s of times during course of time. So its best to have these capabilities right when you start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have already done &lt;em&gt;some research at your university&lt;/em&gt; in field you plan to start a company in (or during the time when you were on a self learning spree) you have a starting advantage to differentiate your AI tech from a potential competitor . You also have brownie points when you speak to potential client or investor and you have some direction already about how would you setup AI and tech pipelines in future. A person who starts after setting up the company will have to figure out many things you have strong intuition about while on a timer. Thankfully for many of us self starters as of August 2020, a lot of smart talent from universities wants to go into FAANGs or established startups of the world (maybe because they have debt) and we have a window to get in and build from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have tried to address beginners with potential points I think they should be aware about, let‚Äôs jump to the core of the article : tricks to get from Zero to One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-product-to-build&quot;&gt;What product to build&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question any team will need to answer is what product to build. The answer will be quite clear to people who have one or more co-founders/mentors who have a deep experience in some domain. Somewhat clear to people who have pre-existing research and background from their university days. You might have seen that my startup had a deficit in both these when we started, so we had to figure this out the hard way. If you are in a situation like us, remember that &lt;em&gt;your early startup idea, the one which you start with, will mostly not work&lt;/em&gt;. A third scenario where you are very confident about your idea is if you are replicating business model of another pre-existing company slightly ahead of yours in curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI has applications in many fields : HR, Insurance, Banking, Retail, Healthcare, Defence/Law Enforcement, Manufacturing, Agriculture and many others which I might not be aware about. How to choose when your founding team doesnt have a specialization in one of the fields already ? There is just one way, that is many rounds of { &lt;em&gt;Market Research ‚Üí Product PoCs ‚Üí Customer Validation} cycle&lt;/em&gt;. Before you think you should try the many (painful/unyielding) rounds of cycles, think if you can bring in a domain specialist in the team, this step can shorten the time period. You will have to spend some amount of funds/equity to try the cycle just like bringing a new co-founder, but a faster result can make bringing a cofounder worthwhile. However, good + experienced people might come very costly (equity/fund wise) and might not want to buy into the brand you have at early stages. You should prefer running a few iterations of the mentioned Pivot Cycle over bringing in a co-founder whom you doubt about being excellent at domain expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-08-30-Patterns-I-Noticed-While-Getting-An-AI-Startup-From-Zero-To-One/media/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-pivot-cycle&quot;&gt;The Pivot Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pivot cycle is to follow algorithm: &lt;em&gt;Repeat (Market Research ‚Üí Product PoCs ‚Üí Letting customers choose you)&lt;/em&gt; until you are sure you are reaching early revenues. Just like the name suggests, its a three step algorithm run in multiple cycles to determine answer to one question : ‚ÄúDoes the business idea pay as much its supposed to ?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs the consumer utility as popular as its supposed to be ?‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very important to be clear about Pessimistic Criterion for success in allocated time period to judge whether an idea is worth pursuing in long run. You should be absolutely clear about it. ‚ÄúX &lt;a href=&quot;https://baremetrics.com/academy/daily-active-user&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;DAU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of avg session length T by end of MM/YY else I shut the business‚Äù in case of B2C or ‚ÄúY &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zuora.com/billing-topics/monthly-recurring-revenue-definition/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;MRR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by selling to N customers by MM/YY or else business is not my cup of tea‚Äù is a concept you should have when you start an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, there is an opportunity cost of pursuing an idea, which is, not working on a business you might be successful at. You will need to test each idea against a time bound benchmark if you need to be able to optimize in a space of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its very easy to fall into the 10 year trap in a situation where you don‚Äôt know what your business idea exactly is even before you jump wholeheartedly into it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NavalBot/status/1280230191755902978&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/NavalBot/status/1280230191755902978&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . You might feel that this is such an obvious thing, you would need to be exactly sure what you want to do before you start but if that was the case you would not have heard of so many startup pivots. I think &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; first time entrepreneurs (I dont know about repeat ones) will figure out what their ideal business is only after a few pivots, however confident they are about their early ideas while starting. So you need to put harsh thresholds on ideas and cut/adapt ideas mercilessly to reach your ideal business. You should not get married unless you are very sure, to a person or to a business. Very sure in a B2B business is if more than one customers start writing recurring cheques for the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important thing which cannot be expressed as methodically is the sequence of ideas to be tried. At our business, we tried ideas sometimes very different and other times derived from each other. From a consumer app to different types of Medical Imaging AI to Retail AI to API platform to Social Media Analytics using AI before we found out what was the thing we could sell. You might want to keep the experimentation a bit lesser than that :-) . We also did experiments in parallel rather than one by one which I found effected focus and hence I recommend experimenting with ideas one-by-one. Some thoughts I personally formed on deciding on AI business ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. If you are thinking of getting into areas with regulatory capture (say healthcare, defence), you just dont need a domain expert, you also need government regulations expert in team. Just having the regulation cleared can be a massive barrier to entry. That said, clearing government norms is almost as much work as building AI and building and selling product. Best to avoid areas with government regulation unless you have very experienced team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Low hanging fruits in AI, or things you can use a freely available Deep Learning model to solve, are generally thought of as commodities by investors (so early investors may often be confused as whether they should invest or not), but these might also be very solid and quick scaling business ideas if you know target audience to sell them. You might have to worry about your moat though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. If you choose the path like us that is an AI product in a large niche, your moat will be building specialized narrow R\&amp;amp;D capabilities and rich datasets. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also remember that framework that investors think in is different from what entrepreneurs (techie people specially) think in. You might need to develop more empathy towards investors and how they function. So, let me define the early life of a startup in stages :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-08-30-Patterns-I-Noticed-While-Getting-An-AI-Startup-From-Zero-To-One/media/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I am speaking here about how to get through the pivot cycle and figure out the most important things according to me, idea and execution, VCs will almost always be more interested in looking at ‚ÄúBusiness Practices‚Äù or ‚ÄúRepeatability in Business‚Äù. This is just the next step after finding out the idea, which is making the startup success replicable for growth stages. So while in the Pivot Cycle, you will run experiments to figure out 1. The Product and 2. The utility, the investor will also be interested in knowing a third thing beyond 1 and 2, whether you can easily prove the utility to more and more people. This repeatability in business requires A. setting up salesforce in form of digital marketing, inside or outside sales and B. creating a financial model for your startup, which you need to do only after you finalize the business idea you want to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;iterating-the-pivot-cycle&quot;&gt;Iterating the Pivot Cycle&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs try to understand one iteration of the pivot cycle. The steps in one cycle as I said earlier are as follows :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Come up with a budget, an idea and a reasonable pessimistic time bound target for the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Do market research about the idea before you invest in it, you should do it along with step 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;em&gt;Build the product and sell it to N first clients. {Whoa!}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Try your best to achieve metrics you have set as targets and take a strict non nonsense call at the end of the time/budget predecided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While 1,3,4 is something one can think of as definitely possible in a fixed timeframe (finite one time tasks), the feasibility/ease/hardships of building an AI Product and selling it to first N clients in a fixed time budget is hard to wrap ones head around (specially if they dont have experience building selling a product). Let‚Äôs for example say possible goals can be 8-12 months to build and sell an AI first product from scratch for $5000/year to 40 clients (SaaS) or for $70,000/year to 3 clients (enterprise). Beginners dont really have a standard to 1. set such goals and 2. compare whether the goal set is hard or easy, feasible or infeasible. This is an interesting phenomenon that humans can intuit, internalize and estimate quantities well when they have an inbound meter/category to compare against : &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/NNnIGh9g6fA?list=PL150326949691B199&amp;amp;t=495&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/NNnIGh9g6fA?list=PL150326949691B199\&amp;amp;t=495&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Check 5 minutes of the video from the timestamp I link here to get an idea of what I am trying to share, the whole video is very interesting though). If you are a beginner you can safely assume that either way you guess feasibility of goal set wrt point 3 above(say 8-12 months for such a target should be chill or this should be hard) based on your optimistic or pessimistic nature has no data point attached. I myself personally was clueless about good benchmark to set to take decision on an idea when we started our company, ‚ÄúWhen is an idea good enough to pursue as the product of the company?‚Äù. So temporarily while you read this section, you will have to live with my measure of feasibility/not-possible of a goal you can set for a business idea. We did a few iterations of the pivot cycle in our startup before early revenues and thus my judgment of feasibility is based on these 4-5 datapoints. From my experience 8-12 months is ambitious to build an AI product from scratch collecting around 250k US$ in Annual Revenue and is a hard target to achieve. You will need to hurry from day1 and take shortcuts and maybe keep the maximum horizon a bit longer per experiment than 12 months (say 15-18 months per idea, total 2-3 iterations of Pivot Cycle in 3 years if you can stretch your seed funding for that much). These numbers are based on markets which pay slightly less (Asia for example) and so your equivalent goal in North American market will be say around 500k USD of annualized revenue in same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptualizing, building and selling the product in a fixed time needs you to work very differently (sometimes in an non obvious way) as compared to when you are selling a product whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;Product Market Fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (PMF) has been achieved. When we observe sales or product management practices of evolved/famous companies around, we generally see the sales and products of companies after their PMF. It is a very bad call to compare a new startup you are going to form where you are not yet sure about the idea with a company which is in growth stage or at least ahead in their PMF journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain why. In the early stages of your idea, you are trying to solve a complicated mess of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_\(logic\)&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;chicken-egg problems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or dead ends. Please try and appreciate the following dependency graph about planning in an early AI startup :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-08-30-Patterns-I-Noticed-While-Getting-An-AI-Startup-From-Zero-To-One/media/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike in Product Management of a more ‚Äústable‚Äù startup, its very very hard to plan in detail all aspects of a AI product very early on if you are going to run a pivot cycle because there are things you cannot quantitatively estimate (look at the cannot think further symbol in the diagram above). You get slightly better with each pivot, but there will always be open ends. Every pivot will need all of technology building, product building, setting up data ops and closing first few sales in time bound manner, which effectively means doing things in a scrappy way. As you can probably realize, perseverance and pragmatism are two skills first time entrepreneurs should get better at to survive the pivots. This is quite in contrast to if you are experienced and know exactly what to target, that‚Äôs why I suggested if you can get an excellent domain aware co-founder if possible, you will have to struggle less. However, if this domain expert cofounder makes error in identifying the problem to solve, it is going to be really hard to do the pivots with all the new constraints. Pivot cycle requires you to take hard decisions, cut things and burn bridges after the time of an idea runs out. Someone whose reputation is on the line might find it harder to do so. There have been times when I said no to a client who came back after a very long time and we had pivoted the idea because it did not make the cut, very unfortunate and painful but cannot help it really!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lesson from being in a soup of open ended problem is : ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt strive for perfection. Strive for survival.‚Äù Introducing our friend Small Wins : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Small-wins%3A-Redefining-the-scale-of-social-Weick/3c45ee6989cfe84f1f4866e26dbe7fae93de26b8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Small-wins%3A-Redefining-the-scale-of-social-Weick/3c45ee6989cfe84f1f4866e26dbe7fae93de26b8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . Small wins is a political concept which says that you dont need to solve the entire problem which overwhelms you, just figure out the most important set of subproblems and focus on them. Basically, your aim should be to turn people‚Äôs opinion from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think what you are trying to do is possible‚Äù to ‚ÄúCool idea you have got there, but that‚Äôs not how its supposed to be done‚Äù or better ‚ÄúHere take my money and solve your s**t by doing ABC‚Äù. Once that is achieved, there is better chance that an aggregated and more ambitious attempt will be made to solve the entire problem. I will of course tell what the important subtasks were which we choose to solve in our startup first, but please note that these focal points might be different for different startups based on their team, business and investors. In the initial phases of the enterprise AI product idea, the following points are what we gave more importance to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Optimize for getting cash in the bank fast. That proves your business idea has utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. In light of 1, build initial versions of products to make sure that you can deliver best results fast to early clients. Dont go for premature optimization, remember you are not even sure this is the idea you will be working on if it doesn‚Äôt prove itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Run Business Development in parallel with Product Development if you want to achieve the time bound goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-the-initial-versions-of-product&quot;&gt;Building the initial versions of Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so now you have decided to try out an idea in the pivot cycle. How do you go ahead with it ? Here are a few ideas/suggestions from me. I think there are three important themes that an AI entrepreneur needs to think of while developing the product :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enterprise-product-vs-enterprise-utility&quot;&gt;Enterprise product v/s Enterprise utility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably a relevant point only for enterprise-serving startups. I cannot imagine if and how other startups can use this hack. The hack arises from the complexity(and thus high ticket size) of fully-functioning enterprise product. Let‚Äôs try and understand why enterprise products are usually more complex. In a consumer software, consumers typically pay nothing and hence they will be willing to adapt and change their lifestyles around your product. That means you can design and make simple products without trying to customize it for each consumer‚Äôs lifestyle. In fact, it is better than the products are simple as you cannot do consumer support at all and hence they should just ‚Äúget it‚Äù. More complex products with more features might not work just because users have no one to explain it to them. Typical SaaS ticket size products are slightly more complex to address some functionality at the cost of some complexity. The users pay small amounts and unlike consumers are more convinced about the utility when they start using the product to digest the complexity that comes with enhanced functionality. That said, you still dont do customization at client levels in small ticket-high volume SaaS. An enterprise OTOH thinks differently. Enterprises evaluate products on the basis of perceived utility they will deliver. Two important things you need to remember:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Generally, if an enterprise wants to buy a utility, it will be very hard to sell a subset of the utility just your product solves. For success, you need to solve enterprise‚Äôs problem rather than just selling your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. However, enterprises will typically pay way higher than say an individual paying for SaaS because they need a lot of customizations in the way of utility they are procuring and they understand its hard to deliver all that. The customizations help them show results of using a new innovation quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a threshold utility (which is generally quite high) below which enterprises dont want to procure a solution. This threshold utility often means entirety of the usecase they associate with your product and minimal change to an existing workflow they have. So for a document processing AI startup they will want a startup to automatically take data, train and run AI, process it, send it back to their system and automatically show dashboards informative to their stakeholders. Not just that, even in the data processing, they might need some AI algorithms specific to their own usecase apart from the generic ones you might have built. Net net, the utility the enterprise will ask for will be a superset of what you will be taking to them in initial stages. Think of 2-3 enterprises you are trying to sell to in parallel. Most of the time, they will have some overlapping threshold utility and some non-overlapping parts. If you build the entire threshold utility for each client inside your early product, your product will be optimized to serve just one client. That should not be done, your early product should be versatile and nimble that it can fit in use for all your early clients. Your early product should be the overlapping threshold utility part of your early clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-08-30-Patterns-I-Noticed-While-Getting-An-AI-Startup-From-Zero-To-One/media/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have stated three points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. The early product should have the intersection of threshold utility of various early clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. An enterprise client will not buy product unless their threshold utility is fulfilled. So you need to fulfill threshold utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. The aim in the pivot cycle is to quickly sell to first few clients and get money in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a gap here. How to sell when you are only building an early version of product satisfying part of threshold utility. This is where the hack is. Enterprise products should be relatively high ticket size and you would need a customer support team. This team typically consists of analysts, analytics professionals, developers and QA team. While in long term their role is to see that the analytics is running and AI output being sent to client has no errors, in early phase of startup you can additionally use their help to fill in the subset of threshold utility that you are not incorporating in your early product. Basically, while you build a core set of capabilities wihin your product, you invest somewhat more in a relatively large customer support team which builds custom modules to bridge gaps between your product and the expected utility for the client. What is product and what is custom modules ? I understand it wont be clear now. Let me try to show what I saying by taking example of the document processing AI product I was mentioning earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs say that our hypothetical document processing AI &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúProcureDocs AI‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; product uses NLP to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Highlight potential hotspots of a procurement documents. Places where one needs to read, reread and give more thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Detect possible objectionable clauses by/for a vendor in procurement documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[I have no clue about problems with Procurement documents and so all the specs above might be laughable when you look at the market, as long as you can understand that there are some specs for the NLP engine to achieve, we are fine, I did not intend to show anything beyond that]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets say your initial clients are a large mining firm, your local city council and a law firm that uses your product to enhance its services. All potential USD 50k/year deals. However, the following is what they want as their threshold utility to use your product :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-08-30-Patterns-I-Noticed-While-Getting-An-AI-Startup-From-Zero-To-One/media/image5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice, so first of all let me define what I call as product and what I mean by custom modules . Product is the set of things you develop which are generic enough to cater to different clients. So if you want to run a new client‚Äôs data through your AI product without functionality of the product changing, you will have to do minimal to no development. The components of products are regularly tested and developed to scale as the clientele and usage grows. So suppose you have these 3 early clients, one way to solve things would be to just add every required feature into the product. That won‚Äôt be possible however (2 reasons) given A. You will not be lucky enough to start product development after fully understanding the specs for all your early clients, while deployment will be going on for one another one might be in PoC stage and another one in initial talks phase. B. Developing things which can generalize across any number of clients takes time, esp the integration part. Think of creating a dashboard for everyone who wants to use your product : generic, can be utilized across all possible clients, all the stakeholders in each client firm ; this will require a lot of time and iters to build. The more components you build to be used across clients (that is as a part of core product), the more maintenance they want and they reduce the product‚Äôs adaptability. So if you include all early client specs into the product, you will end up either wasting all the time budget you have allotted for one iteration of Pivot Cycle into balancing between requirements or end up making one mini product for each client if you want to achieve time bound sales goal. Both are bad scenarios and slow, the latter still probably allowing you to make a sale in the time budget. The best solution I can think of is diving the specs into core product and custom modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Product should have things you can be reasonably sure that will be useful across all early clients you have. These will be your core AI modules (NLP inference pipelines that you have built), or maybe some way to use different Machine Learning pipelines using same interface. So in our example above, you will have inference for Item Detector, Price Detector, vendor name detector, Requirement Detector, Ambiguity/Unusual language classifier etc in Core Product. You can have different trained model for each of these algorithms, but they can be designed to be used by common interfaces in the core product. So, you can also build higher order interfaces like a detector or a classifier where you can fit any specific model while inference. So for example a classifier interface in code can be used to detect both unusual language and requirements when different models are loaded. We also need components to host AI models as services, run different type of workflow based on configurations, annotation architecture to create training data etc as part of the early product. Essentially the idea is, you put up a configuration file for a client containing workflow and weights of models trained and your product can process documents related to that client. The early product will also include basic I/O like say JSON input files as input and JSON as output. If you are lucky and most of your clients want similar I/O, you should be able to have integrations as a part of the early product too. Requirements that do not fall under the core product specs should be developed as custom modules for clients in early phases. So basically module to automatically email output to one of the clients, automatically read files from fileserver of another client, OCR to convert images to text documents, dashboard for one client, Word to JSON conversion and other such things are better written as custom modules at client level to quickly be able to process their data. Writing generic versions of so many utilities will take too much time to plan and then build so that they co-exist with one another. Time is of essence as you are still trying to figure out whether this product works. So you have a product team building things that become generic across clients and maintaining and scaling components, so that, you don‚Äôt need a mini product for each client, there is a lot of functionality you build using your delivery team, quick and dirty, to make sure that you are able to satisfy threshold utility of the clients without compromising the product‚Äôs adaptibility. You are betting here that there is domain specific data about client integrations and non-essential AI/tech features (right now being built as client specific modules) that you will gather along as you sell to more and more clients and include them in product later if need be, but for now you are trying to keep the product minimal and sell as fast as possible. Only the core features go into the early product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you might ask is whether having a core product is even necessary ? We are just testing an idea here, why not just build separate set of ‚Äúmodules‚Äù for each client and sell them fast ? Why to even keep even a relatively smaller set of common functionality ? Apart from ofcourse less copy pasting code, more maintainability and less fuss while being deployed (Remember you just dont have to make code run once, you have to keep it running for the first revenues to come in), this also helps you to think hard and define the invariants of your products. These invariants make a product company different from an enterprise services company. A enterprise services company will not say No to most projects within their circle of competence, a product company will say No to projects not fitting these invariants. Also, according to me addressing these invariants will bring some structure into the first few deployments making them fast, as you are solving a recurring problem. Faster deployments will help you make a decision in the time budget. You dont want to waste time by preparing for circumstances you are not sure you will encounter, but for the pattern of problems you encounter frequently, you should reduce down the complexity so that you can delegate them and dont need to solve them twice or thrice. Let us take examples of invariants that you get as components of the early product of ProcureDocs AI. Invariant components of this product will turn out to be, at a very high level, entity extractors and classfiers, and then more specifically, you will have entity extractors like Item Detector, Price Detector, vendor name detector etc and classifiers like Requirement Detector, (classifies a paragraph say into requirement/not) Ambiguity/Unusual language classifier (classifies things as ambiguos/non-ambiguos) and so on. Once these invariants are set, other members of your team take responsibility of working on individual components and improving them. When I tried to Google hard about what such invariants are called in Product Management lingo, I found that a closely linked term is Product Architecture : https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-architecture/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you have done in this step are not rules set in stone for the product. Once you are reasonably sure about product, you can choose to invest in the future than solve for the now. But, when you need a small win on a time budget, your risk appetite should be low and you can do some of what established companies would avoid as short-termism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-the-early-core-product&quot;&gt;Building the Early Core Product&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the second layer of the product onion. While you probably now are convinced by my premise that you need to have a core product and custom module for catering to enterprises, here is some more discussion about the core product. It isnt over yet ! Unlike the previous section on Enterprise Utility, this section is applicable to all sort of AI first products, so if you are a SaaS or consumer product in AI, this section would still be relevant. Few things you should consider here are :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. Solve problem(s), dont just build an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Dont optimize prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. AI products follow Prototype ‚Üí Demo ‚Üí Annotate ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Feedback process. Dont wait for AI to get perfect before you sell/luanch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first premise is, dont start from Deep Learning algorithms when you are building the product, but rather from a problem statement. In our Procuredocs AI example above, dont start thinking like, ‚ÄúNLP has classification and language models, now what can be done on enterprise documents related to procurement ?‚Äù You need to take a real world problem (rather problems) as a starting point, which people actually want to pay for and plan your AI layer on top of that. Understanding what real problems exist on an enterprise dataset is what the Market Research step of the pivot cycle tries to find out. Now for all possible problems existing on an enterprise dataset (procurement documents for our hypothetical ProcureDocs AI), your Data Science expert needs to think and decide the problem(s) to solve that : 1. Have the largest TAM and 2. is/are feasible using existing Deep Learning/AI tech. Given you dont have research resources of Google and dont have pre-existing research from your university days, you will need to depend upon existing research a lot, at least for early versions of products, before you develop your own R\&amp;amp;D in product‚Äôs domain. So you need to figure out what all problems on a dataset are theoretically solvable given you had a large dataset at your disposal for training AI algorithms. Remember a real world problem can be solved with a combination of AI algorithms, rather than just one. Foor example, ProcureDocs AI can use different models to recognize sentences with ambiguous requirements and detecting line items and their prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are startups which try to solve problems using AI which have no previous research done on them and maybe not really technologically feasible. I dont know how do these startups really solve them. When we are choosing problems the startup will need to solve, we need to keep in mind that there is a reason that some categories of problems don‚Äôt have feasible/working solutions in existing world. You may be able to solve it by creating totally new research, but when you are trying to evaluate an idea in a time bound way, its not plausible. More on problem selection later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second point is that you need to avoid falling into the trap most Product people want to fall into. Over optimizing product or running behind perfection. Trying to make product scalable/efficient/generic/pretty/easy to use (.. and 100 other adjectives which PMs would like to list on their CVs..) are useful efforts only after you are sure that you are going to stick to and sell a product. You are probably building something which 0 or 1 or &amp;lt;5 companies have built in the world, or it might not be even feasible to build. Rather than building the best possible early product, the best use of efforts is to just figure out an ugly, inefficient but feasible and fast path from just an idea to early $s in MRR. Once you achieve that, you can work on all the other optimizations. If you waste precious time from your idea time budget optimizing for any of the adjectives and in fear of lower margins for first few clients, you might never be able to get early clientele you want for the product to actually stick around and run. If you believe that perfect products can be designed in first iteration, you need to think about the early beta releases of software products you use now. Were they as good as they are in thir recent versions ? Mostly No. Let me introduce you to Mr. Gall ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_\(author)&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ), who says that most successful/awesome complex systems are design improvements of other less sophisticated systems. Very few awesome things were developed in the first epoch. So dont optimize prematurely, focus on your aim during pivot cycle, validate the idea ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next point is dont wait for the AI to become perfect before you first approach customers. In a limited time/money budget, its hard for you to 1. Collect enough Data, 2. Annotate data and 3. Do R\&amp;amp;D to invent the state of the art algorithms to get the perfect AI algorithm. If you are waiting for AI to evolve to the level when your product will be in production, before your first sale, I think you are just trying to be in your comfort zone. Customers are buying the AI you will deliver in the long run and not what you have when you speak to them for the first time. All you need to start working on making the first sale is some AI magic that you can show the customer (that might be AI working on couple of simple images or documents for our hypothetical Procuredocs AI), however you quantify ‚Äòsome‚Äô and ‚ÄòAI magic‚Äô. These early AI magic results or Prototype as I call them in the Prototype ‚Üí Demo ‚Üí Annotate ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Feedback process is what you need to demo the AI to client first. Once you demo your product, you setup Annotate ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Feedback for the remaining round of rollouts and deployments, where you ‚Äúannotate‚Äù more client data, ‚ÄúBuild‚Äù that is train deep learning model and deploy and then taker errors made by the Deep Learning models as ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù to create more training data and make the underlying models better. Remember, for now we know that no amount of clever training tricks and hacks can beat a Deep Learning model trained on large volumes of data. The more data you get feedback on and feed to the AI model, the more unbeatable your deployment for the client becomes. However, this is a journey you will have to take by setting expectations of the client and working towards increasing accuracy of AI models, you cannot have the full-blown AI ready on day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-08-30-Patterns-I-Noticed-While-Getting-An-AI-Startup-From-Zero-To-One/media/image6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-startupy-terms--pmfmvp-and-the-product-adaptability---efficiency-tradeoff&quot;&gt;The startupy terms : PMF/MVP and the product adaptability - efficiency tradeoff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will come across the terms : Product Market Fit and Minimum Viable Product in traditional SaaS. How do these terms measure up in Enterprise AI ? According to me, MVP and PMF are not really points in startup timeline but rather continuums. You start developing a PMF the more of your MVP you develop. Enterprise products are just too complex and the threshold utilities so non-intersecting that thinking of developing a product that satisfies demands of all clients in the beginning before you start selling is [what I feel most people think of as MVP] is just hard to even think of. These continuums start from the Pivot cycle stage and continue to &amp;lt;figuring out repeatability in business&amp;gt; stage of the product. I would rather want to think of the product evolving from an adaptable product (in pivot cycle) which can cater to first customers for getting quick early revenue to an efficient one (if it graduates to the repeatable business stage from pivot cycle) around more common usecases for maximizing margins. You start getting closer to your MVP as the product starts getting more efficient and your Product Market Fit starts somewhere when you have achieved a certain level of efficiency and MVP. To be specific, PMF starts when you know that there are clients who will buy but you have to make product more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-08-30-Patterns-I-Noticed-While-Getting-An-AI-Startup-From-Zero-To-One/media/image7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;selling-the-product-for-the-first-few-times&quot;&gt;Selling the Product for the first few times&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will talk about some patterns I figured while selling product for the first few times to early customers. I think there will be disagreement/difference of opinion about initial sales based on founders‚Äô personalities and how long they commit to try an experiment out in their pivot cycle. So disclaimer right now, your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-is-no-perfect-market-research-or-maybe-just-one-way-to-do-it&quot;&gt;There is no perfect Market Research [Or maybe just one way to do it]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other alternative headings can be ‚ÄúAlways be ready for surprises in early phase of business‚Äù or ‚ÄúA map is not the territory‚Äù- &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map‚Äìterritory_relation#&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation#%22A_map_is_not_the_territory%22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . A beginner might ask the following questions if they have read the essay till this point: ‚ÄúEven before building a product you should have done market research and confirmed that clients should pay for it right ? Why do you need a Pivot Cycle at all then ?‚Äù. Also many people might have the image that your sales method should be sealed the day you take feedback from perspective clients because you have already figured out a way to build a pipeline by how you lined up these feedback interviews. ‚ÄúIf I do perfect Market Research, I should basically be building an invincible product and sales methodology‚Äù might be another thought people would have while building a B2B/Enterprise product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally believe that perfect market research is not possible (You can just avoid the Market Research step in case your team has lot of experience. I will talk about this scenario later). Let me try to convince you about my opinion before I start explaining you what you mostly cannot have it all figured out before you start. How many entrepreneurs do you think make the massive blunder of trying out an idea without proper market research ? It is definitely below 73% in my opinion. Try checking with your fellow entrepreneurs, most I know did market research to the best of their ability. However, it seems what people initially imagine and plan for their business to be rarely happens : &lt;a href=&quot;https://actu.epfl.ch/news/where-to-play-a-practical-guide-for-running-your-t/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://actu.epfl.ch/news/where-to-play-a-practical-guide-for-running-your-t/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . 73% of startups pivoted in a 10,000 startups study by EPFL. According to me there are three reasons for it : 1. Many facts you think you know about an industry when you are not as experienced, are actually just assumptions, not real facts and assumptions can be wrong. 2. People (both entrepreneurs and their contact points) can easily overestimate themselves and their capability to execute and 3. Many customers dont know what they want, so the initial feedback you collect about ideas has a low signal to noise ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In enterprise AI, there are added factors :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. AI as a technology has limitations. However, the status quo changes quickly and replaced by less-restrictive bounds. Its hard to estimate what progress will AI make in a limited timeframe. So when you are doing market research there is a very real possibility of under/overestimating AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. There are no well researched and tried recipes to set AI businesses in motion. Many business people dont understand AI well and many AI enthusiasts dont understand business well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Movies and MSM sensationalize news about AI, you will find extremely high expectations or paranoia more than you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So good market research and customer profiling will increase the probability of success of an idea, but you can never be sure. Except in one case : when you are copying an existing business model and your founders/important team members come from a competitor. If you are lucky enough to be in such a scenario, you dont even need market research. Just copy and build one advantage over the competitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;early-customers&quot;&gt;Early Customers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most important event for any B2B company is the time when they figure out who are going to be their early client(s). Good early customers are a must for an idea to move from a concept to some kind of business. Remember the figure above where there were too many open ends when you were trying to decide how to build and make your first sale. A good early client will help you make it slightly easy to navigate through that maze. We were lucky in our startup to get some extremely good early clients and thus could make the first few sales along with product development. Some points I would like to suggest about early clients in case of AI startups :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Start searching early for your first clients. Dont wait to build the entire product. In the Prototype ‚Üí Demo ‚Üí Annotate ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Feedback process, you should try to get early clients around demo step, maybe even during the time you are building the prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Your early clients need to be senior people. Maybe a top position at a company, director of X or VP of Y type designations (in large organizations for an enterprise product). Dont fall in the trap of talking to even slightly junior people. You need a very capable and experienced person to A. Understand the product vision of a new product and more importantly B. help push a totally new technology without any references into a company, just on pure merit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. It helps if your early client is technologically aware. Even better if they are enthusiastic about AI. They can understand constraints and give accurate feedback about product and how to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Another very important thing is the willingness and patience of the client to review many iterations of the product and try to guide you with how much better your technology needs to be to make the cut. Very very few people apart from your early customers can help you with this type of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infact, in some ways, if you just solve the step of getting good early clients, that is all you need to do to make your first few sales. Everything else you will be able to figure out along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-setup-a-sales-team-right-from-day-1&quot;&gt;Dont setup a sales team right from day 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very important observation. Early sales hires are not going to be able to do anything. The first few sales the company makes are very different from how its salesforce will work later. Your company in the long run, should use outside sales (where your salespeople go and meet senior executives) or inbound sales (where you use marketing to create interest and get customers to approach you rather than you approaching the customer), as both the methods optimized to sell product at scale. But in the case of first few customers, the story will be different. The first few sales will be glacial, where you will be building different components of your products demoing and taking feedback from early clients until you have something good enough to sell. So selling to first few customers will not be optimized for scale but survival. Later, there will be a time where you will have to put thought into increasing the speed of sales after you are reasonably confident that you have satisfied the usecase of your early clients. Early sales are somewhat like how a door-to-door salesman sells, that is you will have to build trust, demo it and then only someone will buy your product, but with added complexity that you are creating components of product while making the sale. Examples of such inside sales process is abundant in IT services companies. However, IT services companies scale by using the trust earned in the first sale by upselling more services, which is a path a product startup cannot take, requiring them to make a switch to other sales methodsafter early customers. In fact, the indication of an idea graduating the pivot cycle and becoming THE product for a startup when the company starts thinking about scaling up sales and getting frustrated at how slow the initial inside sales process works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need to take away from this section is that if you hire sales people day 1, they will not be able to help the business as startup sales professionals are typically trained to sell products at scale via outside sales or inbound sales. So founders will generally need to make the first few sales themselves. This will require them to resist the pressure to grow super fast in the pivot cycle and invest into understanding usecase deeply, solving it and getting the first $$ into the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-the-team&quot;&gt;Running the team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will speak about a few things I observed while conducting the team. To be very truthful, when I started as an entrepreneur, I did not really believe in when other (very successful) ones said that building a good team is very important for the startup. That is because, in early phases of idea, a founder themselves manages lot of complexity, product, sales, tech etc. and they feel that they will be able to grow just using their personal ambition and force of commitment. Maybe that is why I felt earlier that all you need is good founders and some team which can do work. However, as the company grows and founders start becoming bottleneck, you start understanding why team building is extremely important. Like most other things in this article, this lesson was learnt the hard way. You need a motivated, good, solid team and also you need that strong founder instinct and then maybe you will succeed is what is my understanding now. You have 24 hours in your day and maybe you work with the highest efficiency x units/hour and still you will have upper limit on capacity. The work of a founder will quickly expand to fill all their time. When the company is scaling up faster than how fast you increase your productivity and you are all tied up and still more is required, there is no option but to have a team that can rise up to the occasion. My thoughts and lessons I learnt running an AI team in following headings :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adventure-loving-and-responsibility-loving-attitudes&quot;&gt;Adventure-Loving and Responsibility-Loving attitudes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tasks of every team in a startup has two components : Adventure and Responsibility. In product team, you need to make sure about reliability and test coverage and uptime and adding features which sales team demands, things you absolutely need for putting bread on the table. This component of work of product team I would call responsibility component of their job. Then there is scaling up of web services to serve twice the number of requests, making query on database 2X faster or making sure image are transferred faster to websevice from client are type of tasks I call as the adventure side of their job. In AI team, you have regular training of models to make sure newly discovered image categories are accounted for, updating NLP models with new upcoming text, updating different models for different customers, new annotations on data to increase accuracy of existing methods etc are what I think of as Responsibility side of their job. AI team can call thinking of methods to deploy models using less resources, developing new AI algorithms and training methods as adventure part of their job. Let me also extend this analogy to business team as well. Regular client calls, follow ups, making decks better, contacting and onboarding new clients, making sure delivery and client relation stays good etc. are part of Responsibility side of their job. On the other hand, getting on client calls to push for closures, exploring new products and a few other things can be thought to be adventure side of their job. I hope those examples help you intuit about the two type of tasks. To give it some kind of definition from my perspective: adventure tasks are totally open ended, that is the only thing you need to know about them is the goal needed to be achieved and then you figure out the way, while responsibility tasks have more structured paths with obstacles along the way to overcome. Responsibility tasks require handling some open ended complexities to sort out a well defined goal in a fixed time period, so it requires more of diligence and problem solving. Adventure tasks require more of risk taking and problem solving. So why such a long paragraph to convince you about this dichotomy ? In my limited experience, I have seen that people have preference towards one of these type of tasks. So if someone is trying to solve a problem, they will try to view it in the lens of Adventure like tasks or Responsibility like tasks. Because there are preferences involved, one type of people will view the behavior of others as too risky or stuck in the rut. &lt;em&gt;This is a good struggle to have in a startup.&lt;/em&gt; You need both type of people who would use their respective forces to shape the journey, business, product and AI of startup into a halfway non-extreme path. Generally the best path is a combination of two thought extremes. When the pivot cycle begins, everything is an adventure like task and so adventurous people will basically be leading things more, but as the company figures things out and grows, adventurous tasks will reduce in number and increase in complexity and consistency tasks will take over the rest. There is never a dearth of adventurous tasks but you need to know that consistency needs to prevail in most parts of a successful organization for adventurous people disrupting smaller harder-to-crack bottlenecks of it. Adventurous-task loving people will have to thus learn to relinquish control over things which they controlled initially and move to harder problems to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, humans have a bias towards admiring the risk taking dimension of character more than their consistency. So people who are risk taking get more psychological rewards than responsible ones. I feel that probably people become more risk taking because either they are conditioned to feed off this adulation or they love the adrenaline. So in AI team, there will be people who will always try to invent new tricks and publish new papers or write a deployment framework which makes deploying your algorithm 20% cheaper. This gets them somewhat more of a fame both within the team and sometimes even from outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there will be people who will get the day to day work done, run the algorithms through client studies, see where the algorithms were not working well and try to address the blind spot, train on newly data collected etc. These responsibility seeking rockstars are not praised enough. They thus might feel that they are working on irrelevant things and sometimes feel bad about their jobs even. Now of course if one is an adventurous type of person stuck in a role requiring too much responsibility, they should and might feel trapped, but I have seen people being really good at consistency/responsibility and not very willing to jump on open ended problems or less charted paths feeling bad about their job too. That is because we have probably built a world based on television and twitter and facebook where instead of encouraging adventurous type roles, we have started shaming responsibility type roles. If you dont work on an open-source project you are a bad engineer or the real salesperson is the one who closes the sales type of mentality makes our consistent folks feel incomplete for nothing. You are just different type, not inferior ! So many excellent responsibility-preferring people really good at their jobs live hating themselves due to groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is both type of people are important in an organization, probably more responsibility seeking people than risk takers in established ones and the other way round in nascent ones. As the organizations become large, they will gather a larger number of responsibility-preferring people and thus will become averse to risky behavior allowing adventurous people to build a new B2B product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I am not profiling people into baskets. I just am saying most (I think all) people have a preference towards adventure type jobs over responsibility jobs or vice versa, but not saying people liking adventurous tasks dont have diligence or people preferring responsibility tasks cannot take risks. One example I can immediately recollect is Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ) who was an explosive batsman taking lot of risks and scoring really fast in early phases of his career. However, now that he is captain of Indian team and looking from more of an organizational perspective, he has changed his game to focus on consistency. He doesnt get the super high scores of earlier, but now ensures he scores decent runs in most innings he plays. One is not better than the other, see ! One thing most employees and founders need to understand is which of these types of roles they are good at (and not which of them they like as most would like adventurous tasks due to human bias) and recognize/develop their circle of competence well rather than doing something sub-optimal. If you feel frustrated in uncomfortable situations, try using your love of order to develop your skills in responsibility tasks (No one likes a person whose comfort zone is doing nothing), if you feel trapped in day-to-day tasks, try combining your love of freedom with ability to achieve (No one likes an adventurer who gets nothing done). Also learn to recognize this diversity and appreciate people for their skills than dislike them for their differences from you. As a manager (you are a manager for free when you are a founder), you need to recognize the strength of people and use their help in tasks accordingly where they can contribute better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-08-30-Patterns-I-Noticed-While-Getting-An-AI-Startup-From-Zero-To-One/media/image8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distribute-complexity-dont-delegate-it-or-fall-for-illusion-of-control&quot;&gt;Distribute Complexity, Dont delegate it or fall for illusion of control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second concept that I would I like to mention is around inter-team co-ordination. Your startup will form natural teams when you do your day to day work. So as an enterprise AI company you will coherent teams around : 1. AI/Deep Learning stack management 2. ETL and webapp/mobile app management, 3. Client Success team, 4. Data Annotation and ops team, 5. Salesforce and Marketing team and maybe more dependent upon your business idea. These teams have very good communication internally as they sit for scrum once or twice everyday and members are involved in solving similar problems. However, when it comes to inter-team communication, there will always be gaps and lags. You can avoid this till you have say a 6 ‚Äì 8 people team by making sure the concept of sub-teams of people within startup doesn‚Äôt exist at all, but after a certain number of employees its inevitable. These gaps between different teams are hard to fill, due to two different reasons :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Lost in translation : Business related information originating at client-sales interface or at client-delivery interface is known second (or third or say fourth) hand to a person in tech team and they can decipher it very differently that what it is intended to convey. Information sometimes doesnt even reach the tech person because some manager thought they are not required to know about the business problem but only the tickets related to it. Similarly, Tech information originating at Technology-Problem interface might be visualized at business-client front as too trivial or a big blocker unlike what it actually is. People overestimate their part and underestimate others‚Äô parts by a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Open ended questions cannot always have answers : There are always issues for which you will not have answers when you start to work on it. This basically makes different teams work with different assumptions abstracting out what they cannot incorporate into their mental model. After completion of some work, you might find that two teams might have made progress in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While one responsibility of the founders is to keep this inter-team communication gap minimal, let‚Äôs face it, you cannot make sure everyone has exactly the right information everytime in a dynamic environment as the organization scales up. Soviet Union tried to do that with their economy and they are history ! Let‚Äôs understand what happens when inter-team communication is weak and only after we understand how events unfold, we can understand how I propose to solve them ‚ÄúDistribute Complexity‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let‚Äôs say that there is a complex problem a sub-team within startup has to solve it. Say, business team has to convert a new and tough client or Technology team is working on a new feature which requires throwing away lot of code or AI team is starting to use a new Deep Learning architecture in production or Marketing team is thinking about a new blogging style. Everyone needs to admit that the problems they are trying to solve are not just theirs or someone else‚Äôs problems totally. So for example, Business team knows the client needs a very good AI demo to sell, so they cannot just say, the AI team should build a very accurate demo ad we will be able to sell. Similarly, when AI team introduces a new algorithm into the system, they cannot just say, let the Business or Client Engagement team wait for the feedback from client and tell us if there was any obvious issue. Or marketing team needs a set of technical blogs, they just send a mail to technology teams to deploy posts on the blog page. I have seen this attitude in many companies. Basically do not delegate all the complexity away to someone else who you think should do it as its their responsibility. Distribute the complexity, solve some parts yourself, let the other team solve some part of the problem. This attitude will only come if founders enforce it from the start, otherwise its very easy for one team to start delegating all the complexity away and working only on fun stuff from their comfort zone. So for example, for the hard client above, the business team can try to manage expectations about the demo to a level which the AI team can promise building given available resources, or the marketing team can take blog post from the tech people and try to make it better SEO wise rather than delegating everything. I feel if the culture of distributing complexity exists, startup will easily overcome unclear inter-team communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an exactly opposite problem to ‚ÄúComplexity delegation‚Äù and that is ‚Äúmaintaining illusion of control‚Äù. One very common example here is one team or person trying to do tasks inefficiently beyond their circle of competence. So software executives trying to setup a framework for Artificial Intelligence team, or business team deciding what database to use in the backend are quite common examples from such a culture. While there is some merit in people going beyond their ability and doing things not expected from them, doing it inefficiently always will not work. Founders need to advice good control and let people solve things and discourage them depending upon what they feel is optimal or suboptimal for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;problem-solving-hierarchy&quot;&gt;Problem Solving Hierarchy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone solves one or the other problem in a startup. However, one needs to recognize that they have 24 hours in their day and can only work as much per day on an average. Basically, what I am describing here is the intra-team component of my thought about ‚ÄúDistributing Complexity‚Äù. Just like within teams you see these two extreme attitudes of delegating everything and containing everything, similar dynamics plays out within teams as well. There are some teams where the leader delegates a bit too much and junior team mates have to look into complexity issues they probably are not as well prepared to solve and then on the other end of spectrum there are leaders who want to solve all complexities themselves and delegate only what they think is ‚Äúsimple‚Äù becoming a bottleneck for the team and company. Try not to be these people! Try and understand that you are one person, can do one person‚Äôs work and you will need a team to achieve larger goals than what one person can build. So as a founder, you need to do 100% work as an individual contributor plus strategist and manager and also need to make sure the right amount of complexity is assigned to members of your team based on their profile and experience. Thoughts of perfection around ‚ÄúOnly me can get all work done with least amount of failure risk‚Äù is misplaced as its costs time and makes work slow. Rather recognize teams potential for failure and focus on setting up processes that can detect failures early and before they explode. If you delegate a bit too much, you will see your team not making progress, that is a sign that you need to roll up sleeves and lead the team into accomplishments and then delegate back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-08-30-Patterns-I-Noticed-While-Getting-An-AI-Startup-From-Zero-To-One/media/image9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;last-mile-delivery-is-messier-than-you-think--and-its-very-important&quot;&gt;Last Mile Delivery is Messier than you think ! And its Very Important.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This probably applies more to Enterprise startups. Enterprises want data in some consumable format, which they can plugin to their existing systems and custom dashboards which their executives find helpful. That means while there is a product which applies AI on their data, analyzes it and converts it into an Excel file for all data they shared during an hour say, they dont just want this concise output your AI pipeline creates for them. They would want it in specific format, or maybe integrated into their reporting system, or as a custom dashboard. This output format might often be as important as the product‚Äôs utility itself, so you cannot say no! This thus gives rise to need of customer support team(or in their alternative role can also be called customization ninja team) whose aim is to figure out how to quickly solve these one time problems. As I mentioned above, this team is what helps you makes your first sales fast by figuring out quick customizations and helping the product focusing on core concepts. Its basically like you have one airport in the city to/from where you transport all air travelers than building an airport in each locality. Customer Support team figures out a way to make data to/from the team. So unlike in software services, your customer team might need analysts (of course), developers, analytics professionals and BI developers. I have not seen counterpart of such teams in other startups I know (even in the other experiments we run in pivot cycle), so thought it would be worth mentioning about this team. What you need to understand here also is the concept of complexity distribution. Its not always simple to integrate with proprietary systems like how client may expect. Dont just delegate whatever client says to this Customer support team, try setting client expectations and helping the team to close and automate the delivery process faster. Remember, this data to/from movement to your product is sizable work and if it gets slower for a client, the money in bank from this client might get delayed and also would suck time of team who need to manage delivery of the client next in line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-expectations-and-saying-no&quot;&gt;Managing Expectations and Saying NO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that the most important point of business is fulfilling the expectations of clients. However, you need to understand and talk more and more with your client to understand which of the expectations they cannot live without and which of them are good-to-have. Maybe say No in the short term to the good-to-have stuff to make good progress with the clients ? Remember you aim at least in the start is to get money in bank fast to prove the business idea. Developing too many features for a client might make you miss that goal. Another thing you learn to say no are other AI projects not related to your product. If you are trying out an idea to check its potential in pivot cycle, it will already be hard to prove it in a fixed timeframe. I you add more projects into the mix, you are diluting your attention and that increases the probability of a false negative (something that might have worked but you discarded it as something you couldn‚Äôt pull off). Trust me on this, an AI project you are doing without building a product to solve complexities of data pipeline, annotation and client integration around it is going to be extremely hard, learnt this the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;research-in-your-ai-startup&quot;&gt;Research in your AI startup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool, now you have decided to work on an AI startup of yours. There will be some Deep Learning R\&amp;amp;D required as you cannot use off the shelf models forever and your dataset will have its own peculiarities. Here are a few points I would like to share about the R\&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-with-a-real-world-problem-not-an-ai-model&quot;&gt;Start with a Real World problem, not an AI model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I would like to remind you again about is do not start thinking about what problems can you solve with the new cool algorithms you have around you. This leads to a bad cycle of sub-optimal products. Your task as an entrepreneur is to do research about real world problem statement you are trying to solve and then decide two things : A. Is it feasible to solve it using the AI methods available ? B. What method(s) would be required to solve the problem ? A is very important because there are people who get into solving things that AI algorithms cannot really solve like predicting social phenomenon, like say interview success or bullshit like Phrenology: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1276147230295166984&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1276147230295166984&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you are an AI enthusiast joining an AI startup, please do give a thought if the company you are going to join plans to do something nonsensical. B basically is the process of breaking down the usecase into real world Deep Learning (or Machine Learnig problems). In images you can have a combination of Semantic Segmentation and GANs or in the example ProcureDocs AI we have been using, it will be a set of entity extractors and classifiers. Once you are able to figure out B, you have the blueprint to start working on the AI algorithms and hence the product around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-start-expecting-a-research-wonder&quot;&gt;Don‚Äôt start expecting a Research Wonder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way I think you can start building your product with original research is if you were working on something in your university and you discovered something which you think is commercially viable. In all other cases, you need to start with off the shelf Deep Learning (or Machine Learning models) for quick first iteration and sales. In my opinion, you already should be demoing and talking to your clients by the time you think of new research, as that is when you realize what parts of the AI problems you are trying to solve carry more weight-age. Unless you are working on a very obsolete use case, some grad student would have recognized the problem you want to solve and would have published papers on it. Find out existing research for the problem you are trying to solve and build both basic product and baselines before you start anything innovative around new algorithms. Research can never be time bound and the experiment you are doing to evaluate your idea is. If you don‚Äôt find any research on the problem you are trying to work on, that is a signal too. It might be a really hard problem you are trying to solve or you might have not performed step B of previous topic well, that is breaking down the real world usecase into solvable Machine Learning problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-dont-think-that-publishing-interesting-results-is-bad-in-anyway&quot;&gt;I dont think that publishing interesting results is bad in anyway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have come across a few opinions like if you publish the methods you invent, aren‚Äôt you running the risk of people copying your IP ? The answer to that is we are. However, I believe publishing your findings has many important benefits which far outweigh someone using your methods after reading your papers. The first benefit is that while your method goes out into open, you get in touch with many enthusiasts who give you valuable feedback you can incorporate into your research. This feedback when cleverly combined with your existing research gives you even better results. Remember, while someone might be trying to implement the methods you publish in your papers, you will be implementing newer algorithms based on feedback you have received on your publication. The second gain is attracting good HR, who are attracted to your firm by looking at your work. As an early stage startup, it will be hard to hire expensive AI engineers and the only way to tell enthusiasts that good, promising and innovative projects are done in your team is to show them what type of results you publish. You might attract people who buy your tech mission when they read your publications and having a motivated innovative team is a big advantage. The third benefit is that your AI engineers and researchers get rewards which are very important to keep the team morale high during hard times of startup when seemingly no progress is being made. When you are running a pivot cycle and your experiments fail, techies will feel dejected as all the efforts they put into building something will mostly be trashed to make way for a new experiment. While you cannot help doing multiple experiments in pivot cycle, the publications keep the team‚Äôs morale high and they feel they have done something substantial building tech even if the business could not scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;having-a-research-vision-is-important-after-product-graduates-the-pivot-cycle&quot;&gt;Having a Research Vision is important after product graduates the Pivot Cycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The startup needs to have a Research Vision about what the AI team specifically needs to develop in a quarter or year and measure progress with respect to that. Its hard to do time bound research but its not hard to look at the tasks done and estimate if any on-ground progress is being made. A very common mode I have heard a few AI startups go into is Data Scientists working in random directions and not achieving anything concrete. Its very easy to speak a few technical terms in front of non-AI people to overwhelm them and avoid having a discussion about real progress made. &lt;em&gt;So the AI lead needs to&lt;/em&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Have regular review meetings about what are the goals the AI team is striving to achieve in say next quarter or half year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Setup a Research Vision and all projects of AI team must fall in line with this research vision. Research Vision must take in account big pain points of clients and customer support team and the type of datasets company is planning and collecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Make sure there is progress. Data Scientists have their own comfort zone where they read and discuss more and more about possible methods and implement less. An idea means nothing, implement it and prove it works or doesn‚Äôt. More ideas you try out, more are the chances of success. A lot of applied AI research is clever and well informed trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moats-for-an-ai-startup&quot;&gt;Moats for an AI startup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For new entrepreneurs, I would like to define what a moat is. A moat is essentially the world asking you how would your startup survive if say the richest and most innovative person in the world (Elon Musk maybe ? ) thinks of starting a competitor to your startup. The arguments you have in response to this question are guarantee to your investors that their money is safe and to your employees that they are not working on something that can become redundant fast. Its a hard question to answer and people will have answers like Network Effect etc, but we dont really know how this moat phenomenon will shape up for AI startups: &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . I have a few expectations about how a moat for an AI startup might look like in future :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-usual-enterprise-as-a-client-lock-&quot;&gt;The usual Enterprise-as-a-client Lock :&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a really really long time to onboard an enterprise. You do demo/PoC, maybe multiple pilots, integrations, phased rollouts, many customizations once they are onboard and start understanding their internal lingo. Needless to say, this takes a lot of effort on both the teams, the startup and its clients. Inertia thus becomes your friend. Unless you really screw it up or are quite costly, the client will not want to replace you. With an effective pricing and good delivery, you can build a non-fragile business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preferential-attachment-&quot;&gt;Preferential Attachment :&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparatively weak moat which can be achieved by very early movers/winners into a business idea. The idea is to use the first movers advantage to shape the market. A first movers gets the first client credentials, creates the first technology and inventions, creates the first wave in the industry, figures out the first pricing models and creates the first set of experts. Once your people are experts, you can shape narrative of the industry you work in. Unless you miss out on some very important aspect on which the late arrivals cash on (the entire gameplan OTOH for late entrants is to learn from mistakes of the early bird), the early mover is hard to defeat. Most businesses around AI are relatively new context and are waiting to be explored. Good time to build preferential attachments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;infrastructure-moat-&quot;&gt;Infrastructure Moat :&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is possibly the first moat which you see playing out in the real world right now. The trend with respect to AI models that if you can supply large amounts of data, the larger the model, the better it works. GPT3 for example is a huge AI model that can only be deployed on specialized hardware and not commodity hardware available to everyone else in the world. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.developer.nvidia.com/openai-presents-gpt-3-a-175-billion-parameters-language-model/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://news.developer.nvidia.com/openai-presents-gpt-3-a-175-billion-parameters-language-model/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . Now the fact that the NLP predictions by GPT3 are better than anything we have seen before and cannot be replicated by others due to the lack of hardware which can hold the GPT3 model, gives a unique advantage to OpenAI. Basically anyone using OpenAI APIs will get better results than someone trying to keep the model in their own premises. Very interesting economics would shape up here as maybe this is not going to be a monopoly but can become an oligopoly with other big AI players having huge and super accurate AI models they can only host. Such type of an advantage where a new entrant will have to invest substantially in hardware to get parity is achievable by large firms who are incorporating AI into their products or AI startups that have been able to raise a lot of money. That said, infrastructure moat also gives rise to the incentive to bringing huge models back to commodity hardware (say through discretization) and many startups will try (and might succeed) to democratize GPT3 and other huge models again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-moat-&quot;&gt;Data Moat :&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While very large models trained on special hardware might be something that not all companies can afford, even relatively smaller models function better when more annotated data is available with higher variety for them to learn. So when two companies use exactly the same AI algorithms, one having more data to train them will have a better service than the other. So if you can setup a loop in your business which consistently annotates training data for AI making your training dataset bigger and better, you will always stay ahead of the curve. It doesnt just stop here, recent Deep Learning methods have introduced regimes where availability of unannotated data gives better AI performance. So you can be ahead of a newcomer just by having lots of data, even if you dont annotate it. Just having a lot of data can make you stronger than your competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By AI specific hardware, I mean new chips being developed just for running AI algorithms in general. However, in this discussion I will speak about hardware being developed to run Deep Learning algorithms in particular. The reason is : A. Deep Learning algorithms require way more compute than any other AI algorithms and thus AI specific hardware is more desired for them. We already need special Hardware like GPUs to run them for all practical purposes. B. Other Machine Learning algorithms (and even normal data analytics) have started migrating to GPU only recently and not too much work seems to have been done to make specialized hardware for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I removed details specific to my startup (I am one of co-founders of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paralleldots.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;ParallelDots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) from this answer, I found this had become a long essay! Before you read, please understand that this is an opinion/prediction document. I am not an expert at hardware and electronics by any means and there may be mistakes. I am just trying to make sense out of a related but unknown field to my field of work (My work is mostly in the field of Machine Learning and Software).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One subtrend in the recent AI interest post 2012 is that of AI specific hardware. We all know that it takes lot of (costly) hardware to train Deep Neural Network. Every Nvidia-GPU worth training AI on is a costly machine and the recent mega models trained on large repositories data are trained on an insane amount of compute. An excerpt from the latest BYOL self supervised learning paper by DeepMind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-22-Thoughts-on-AI-specific-Hardware/media/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;So, I hope everyone agrees that research on Deep Learning specific hardware is not a bad investment. It can make deploying AI cheaper, reduce CO2 emissions and many do many other good things. More efficient Hardware will give better results. In fact, even the post AlexNet Deep Learning revolution happened because GPUs were made available. Convnets/LSTMs have been around since late 1980s- early 1990s, nothing substancial came out before the hardware was available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs talk now about Computer hardware and AI specific hardware in particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-different-hardware-platforms&quot;&gt;About Different Hardware Platforms&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microprocessorschips-in-our-computers&quot;&gt;Microprocessors/chips in our computers:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand these, we will have to understand how does a program written by a person work ? A programming language compiler converts a program written by a human into a machine readable format. What is a machine readable format ? While most people understand that this is zeros and ones (which is true), in reality, the zeros and ones are actually a low level program that can run on hardware directly. Basically low level instructions are fabricated into the hardware directly. These low level instructions are for example, mathematical operations like Sum, Product, And, Or, Not etc. (General term for this set of logic fabricated into hardware is called instruction set). Now when we are building hardware for a general laptop say, we need to keep the instruction set ‚ÄúTuring Complete‚Äù. Turing Complete is a set of instructions in which any program can be represented. This enables the laptop‚Äôs chips to be generic and run any possible logic. However, a chip having a generic instruction set is not the most efficient chip for any possible problem. The generic instruction set is build in a way it is good enough for most problems, but specialized hardware is often added for tasks which require more computation. For example, Real Number operations (1.0+1.0) are relatively slow on a generic CPU as compared to Whole Number operations (1 + 1) as they require more computation. A hardware which just runs Floating Point computations fast is present in most Computers by default to optimize (due to the prevalence of floating point ops). In fact, VLSI research has progressed enough to make sure the specialized that floating point hardware is small enough to fit on CPU itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gpus&quot;&gt;GPUs:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GP-GPUs ( General Purpose ‚Äì Graphic Processing Units), commonly known as GPUs are specialized hardware to run a set of mathematical operations very efficiently. When the feature rich GPUs came out in late-2000s, they were like a super computer could be installed right on your laptop. The compute GPUs provide actually enabled two big trends : Blockchain and AI. Most new Supercomputers we have now days are clusters of GPU. This is in stark contrast of just one decade back, when they were all special purpose hardware. GPUs are still quite general purpose, in the sense they cannot run all programs in parallel, but can run many mathematical operations in parallel. Due to this, they are costly. A simple trend can be understood that most bitcoin mining (which was one of the biggest usecases of GPUs earlier), has migrated to other specialized hardware as new hashes are rarer to find and incrementally more compute is needed as the currency is used. The special purpose hardware has less generic but more optimized functionality for bitcoin mining bringing the compute cost down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In AI, however, the compute cost is not climbing as much, so well GPUs still continue to be used. Also much more compute is needed at the time of training than deployment. However, there is almost always a debate about deployment as there is significant server costs to be incurred when algorithms are run at scale. While for some applications, the cost might be justified, it might be not for others. So, what do we do to get better bang-for-buck ? Same, less generic and more optimized hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ai-specific-hardware&quot;&gt;AI specific hardware:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two directions of work for AI specific chips :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bitcoin-way-&quot;&gt;The bitcoin way :&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is make more specific hardware than only target the GPU instruction set components aiding Neural Network training (GPUs have a broader instruction set that runs Graphics operations along with other compute). This is how most Bitcoin specific hardware was developed and this has been quite successful there(Technique is called ASICS ‚Äì Application Specific ICs). In AI technology too, many people have tried this model successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google for example is already offering its specialized AI hardware on cloud : &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . We also have attempts by Alibaba (on its AWS competitor) : &lt;a href=&quot;https://techxplore.com/news/2019-09-alibaba-crowns-cloud-powerful-ai.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://techxplore.com/news/2019-09-alibaba-crowns-cloud-powerful-ai.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Intel : &lt;a href=&quot;https://techxplore.com/news/2018-11-usb-neural-debut-event.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://techxplore.com/news/2018-11-usb-neural-debut-event.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . These chips are very efficient for Vector Operations, Matrix Multiplications and graph structured data handling, two most common compute routines needed for Neural Network. AliBaba, for example claims its chip is 15 times more powerful than Nvidia‚Äôs T4 deployment GPUs and way more powerful than P4 when used for inference of product images. While the Alibaba device is offered on its cloud, just like Google‚Äôs device, the Intel device is a &amp;lt;$100 USB device to deploy AI algorithms on laptops or Raspberry Pies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-22-Thoughts-on-AI-specific-Hardware/media/image6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-22-Thoughts-on-AI-specific-Hardware/media/image7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Google and Nvidia have also launched consumer AI deployment hardware like the Intel chip in $100 price range. &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-coral-dev-board-takes-googles-ai-to-the-edge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-coral-dev-board-takes-googles-ai-to-the-edge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/quickly-embed-ai-into-your-projects-with-nvidias-jetson-nano&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/quickly-embed-ai-into-your-projects-with-nvidias-jetson-nano&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More research is being done to try and incorporate Spiking Neural Network operations on ASICS rather than normal Neural Network Operations. Spiking Neural Networks emulate the brain more closely than the Artificial Neural Networks we use more commonly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techxplore.com/news/2018-12-hardware-software-co-design-approach-neural-networks.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://techxplore.com/news/2018-12-hardware-software-co-design-approach-neural-networks.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also efforts to make extremely low power requirement hardware for small or miniature robots to perform Reinforcement learning on edge and learn online as they work in field. One method to do so is to merge traditional Digital and Analog devices for making ASICS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techxplore.com/news/2019-03-ultra-low-power-chips-small-robots.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://techxplore.com/news/2019-03-ultra-low-power-chips-small-robots.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-brain-inspired-way&quot;&gt;The Brain Inspired Way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is a different approach to build AI specific hardware. Also this is more ‚Äúcool‚Äù in the way that it wants to change the hardware implementation quite fundamentally. While Matrix Multiplications and Vector Operations are layer by layer way to abstract a Neural Network operation, One can abstract it out in another way, at neuron level. Infact the Matrix Multiplication and non-linearity combination we use for every layer of Neural Network can be thought of as less efficient way of implementing artificial neurons in one layer of neural network. If we can represent the artificial neuron on the hardware, we don‚Äôt need to even do these costly matrix multiplications (and so hardware costs should go down even more). Essentially the instruction set for running neural networks will now change from Matrix multiplications to neurons. The method is more interesting also because one is building hardware that actually tries to emulate brain Neurons (We do it in software for a very long time, it will now be available in hardware directly). The long term aim here is that we should be able to pack much much more optimized compute for AI algorithms on one chip than what we have now, increasing the training and inference accuracy manifold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how do these hardware designs work you ask ? Let‚Äôs do a mini survey :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that you should probably think about is that these approaches are of two types, A. having programmable weights and dumb thresholding, like what our software based Neural Networks have and B. Working using smart learnable thresholding (synaptic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplest way you can think of the change happening, is at the Transistor layer, where instead of traditional transistor, we use a Neuron Transistor. That is, it takes input charges and can do what a basic artificial neuron does with its input, weighted sum followed by thresholding (thresholding determines whether a Neuron fires or stays inactive for an input). &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2017-06-neuron-transistor-brain.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://phys.org/news/2017-06-neuron-transistor-brain.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; developed a Neuron Transistor in form of a Molybdenum Disulphide flake that works like an artificial neuron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-22-Thoughts-on-AI-specific-Hardware/media/image10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;This however models one Neuron, we have to also build a chip that can model Dense connection between Neurons so that multiple layers of a Deep Artificial Neural Network can be emulated on the chip. In human brain, the process of the dense connections is done by Synapses. These synapses threshold the signal and fire (ie pass information) for a strong signal and stay put for a weak one. &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2018-01-artificial-synapse-brain-on-a-chip-hardware.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://phys.org/news/2018-01-artificial-synapse-brain-on-a-chip-hardware.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have designed this signal carrier layer (or artificial synapses) for use on a chip using a 2D Silion-Germanium material. They have even trained an MNIST classifier using the new synpases hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-22-Thoughts-on-AI-specific-Hardware/media/image11.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another direction of research for brain inspired computing is the one using Memristors. Memristors are electronic components which can both perform computations and store data. The data is stored by programming the resistance of the memristor. If you have seen functioning of any Neural Network, you will be able to relate memristors with Neurons. Neurons both store data (that is weights) and perform computations (forward propagation/ backward propagation) on inputs and weights both. There have always been attempts to learn Neural Networks through memristor elements, as the programmable resistance component help memristors save data as a continuum (like Neural Network weights), rather than binary states like 0/1. In speech recognition/generation, Neural Networks running on memristor can run realtime with respect to Human Speech. &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2017-12-memristors-power-quick-learning-neural-network.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://phys.org/news/2017-12-memristors-power-quick-learning-neural-network.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-22-Thoughts-on-AI-specific-Hardware/media/image12.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;However, the problem with memristors is that the resistance value stored on them is not precise enough (like the float point values F16/32/64 we train/use our Neural Networks at). To counter this, one approach is basically discretize the values of these memory resistances (thus arriving at multiple states like 0,1,2‚Ä¶.) and then use this to store floating points precisely. Afterall, as we saw earlier, even CPUs store all floating points as binary values. This helps us have precise floating points with some tradeoffs. The method is called Memory Processing Units.&lt;/p&gt;

However, too many Memristors would also mean too much need of energy. To solve this, researchers have built atomic level memristors which are energy effcient. Silver and Boron-Nitride topped on Graphene have been used to build such microscopic memristors that can work in parallel. These memristors help model the weighted averaging property of Neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to make molecular level memristors is to use Molybdenum Disulphide (our friend whom we have already seen previously) with Lithium. These memristors can be a way to model thresholding in Artificial Neurons. Molybdenum Disulphide behaves like a semi-conductor generally, allowing less current flow, but in presence of Lithium ions, it changes its structure starting to behave like a conductor. Thus, the amount of Lithium varying can build the thresholding of firing of Neurons, doing what synpases do in real brains. Electric field can control flow of Lithium ions, helping us program the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cool work is doing Associative Learning on a memristor based hardware. Associative Learning for Software based Machine Learning practitioners is what Reinforcement Learning is. While most Memristor based technologies need input-output together to learn, in real world, action and reward are often not happening at the same time. A time-delayed input based Memristor Synapse was invented for this purpose.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-22-Thoughts-on-AI-specific-Hardware/media/image16.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techxplore.com/news/2019-07-programmable-memristor-aims-ai-cloud.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://techxplore.com/news/2019-07-programmable-memristor-aims-ai-cloud.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a programmable memristor circuit which can be used in real world for two-layered Neural Networks. It can still work on toy problems only, but is generic to be trained across whatever domain you want. Big step indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-22-Thoughts-on-AI-specific-Hardware/media/image17.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent innovations include training 3D memristors for the purpose. These enable even more densely connected (deeper due to more possible paths ?) memristor Neural Networks to be run. 3D electronic devices are hard to make from what I can gather and this seems like another big achievement. The unique ‚Äúlocal connections‚Äù based topology these inventors used not only allows them to build a 3D memristor circuit but also train Convnets, in contrast to old memristor technologies which can only use FC layers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techxplore.com/news/2020-05-d-memristor-based-circuit-brain-inspired.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://techxplore.com/news/2020-05-d-memristor-based-circuit-brain-inspired.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar attempt to put many-many memristors together to make the devices capable of inference on real world problems, researches solved the problem of diluted voltage for ion movement in case of many memristors on a chip. They did this by allowing the Silver + node with Copper and using a Silicon -ve node for ion movement voltage. This let them put 100s of thousands of memristors on a single chip. The aim is to do inference on the edge based on small devices rather than GPUs or supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;short-term-impact-on-machine-learning-companies-techbusinesswise-&quot;&gt;Short term impact on Machine Learning companies (tech/businesswise) :&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short Term changes are not really hard to guess. Cloud infrastructure bill for an AI company is comparatively higher than what it should be for a SaaS company of the same scale and revenue. The reason is that they right now use GPUs a lot. There are two types of GPUs in usage :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. Cheaper low power GPUs to deploy AI models. On cloud generally Nvidia T4/P4 are used. This is one area where alternative AI hardware has made inroads. TPUs are pretty common alternative on cloud here and devices like Nvidia Jetson nano , Google Coral and Intel Neural Compute Stick in IoT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Costlier high powered GPUs for training AI algorithms. In fact, for training many large algorithms, you need a GPU cluster. OpenAI trained its recent GPT3 model on one of world‚Äôs most powerful GPU based supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least on paper for both A and B, TPUs seem to be very very cost effective. While my startup has not yet started adapting models to deploy on TPUs yet (we use cheap inference GPUs on cloud for deployment and in office large GPUs for training), AI blogs praise it as a effective device for both purposes in cloud. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/bigdatarepublic/cost-comparison-of-deep-learning-hardware-google-tpuv2-vs-nvidia-tesla-v100-3c63fe56c20f&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/bigdatarepublic/cost-comparison-of-deep-learning-hardware-google-tpuv2-vs-nvidia-tesla-v100-3c63fe56c20f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can assume that in short run, deployment and training of AI will get cheaper with respect to model size. This will have two effects :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Low complexity models will start to be deployed for cases where they are assumed to be too costly right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Larger and more accurate models will be trained. At least for now, it seems ‚ÄúBigger is Better‚Äù is true in Neural Networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúOne requirement for all AI specific hardware platforms is to make the cost to switch very low. The more code needs to be rewritten to adapt software to the new platforms, the bigger gains in performance they will have to show to the people to make the investment to switch.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;long-term-effect-of-ai-specific-hardware--rise-of-automl&quot;&gt;Long Term Effect of AI specific hardware ‚Äì Rise of AutoML&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-was-actually-answering-is-the-relationship-between-ai-hardware-and-gpu-like-that-of-manual-shift-and-automatic-shift-in-cars-&quot;&gt;[I was actually answering ‚ÄúIs the relationship between AI hardware and GPU like that of manual shift and automatic shift in cars ?‚Äù]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good analogy for GPUs and AI specific hardware is IC Engine vs Electric Vehicle hardware. Its a new way of doing the same thing efficiently. For example, no changes in code need to be done to deploy a model trained on Nvidia GPUs and to make it work on Google‚Äôs AI specific hardware(TPUs). You won‚Äôt even feel the difference while working on an AI problem as an engineer, but the hardware that deploys code is more efficient and costs less. Free lunch in some ways (you do lose some flexibility of writing more generic programs with the general purpose hardware as I said earlier, but it doesn‚Äôt matter for most AI algorithms). What is happening with the AI specific hardware is the AI programs we write burn less compute/context in getting translated to hardware code to run (because of some software instructions now directly runnable on hardware without translation) and hence more compute to run the programs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are other technologies, which involve ‚ÄúAI making AI‚Äù and are apt to the automatic-shift vs Manual Shift analogy in AI. If you want to read more about these technologies, good terms to look for are &lt;em&gt;AutoML&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Automated Machine Learning&lt;/em&gt; (both these terms used in automation of traditional machine learning) and &lt;em&gt;Neural Architecture Search&lt;/em&gt; (specific term for Deep Learning). These techniques are not really making writing AI easier for all engineers, but are making writing all AI easier for just a few smart engineers. So just like we are automating some parts of jobs of Software Developers, BPOs, web designers, cab drivers, we are automating low skill AI tasks too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These AutoML techniques are still AI algorithms, which instead of solving a problem directly, learn to develop a problem solver. Just like some humans can better look at an image and describe it as compared to an AI algorithm, there are Machine Learning practitioners who can beat AutoMLtechniques easily as of now (Otherwise, AutoML would win all Machine Learning competitions). There is still art in smart Human Observation and Intuition which these algorithms are far from beating. What AutoML is good at right now is finding out good enough solutions, so you don‚Äôt need an engineer for every single Data Learning problem. However, this is where cheap and efficient hardware (specially very efficient ones like Neurons on Chip hardware) can come in handy. One limiting factor of AutoML (even today) is compute. Efficient Hardware can give computers extreme power to do what computers are really good at for cheap money in the field of AutoML, that is, trial-and-error for learning what humans try to solve by wisdom and intuition. Apart from making AI technology cheaper, this is where I see the greatest potential of AI hardware, scaling up AutoML to actually start getting ‚Äúsuperb‚Äù results from ‚Äúgood‚Äù results like right now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I wrote this as an explanation of how AI specific hardware (in fact also how any hardware) works in combination with the Software and how it might effect AI startups in short term and long term.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Observations On Ongoing Coronavirus Pandemic</title><link href="https://muktabh.xyz/2020/06/10/Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Observations On Ongoing Coronavirus Pandemic" /><published>2020-06-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-06-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://muktabh.xyz/2020/06/10/Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://muktabh.xyz/2020/06/10/Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic.html">&lt;p&gt;This is a combination of many recent Quora answers of mine related to ongoing COVID19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-what-is-herd-immunity-and-how-can-it-be-effective-for-countries-like-india-&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúWhat is herd immunity, and how can it be effective for countries like India? ‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pNywoi&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/pNywoi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHerd Immunity‚Äù is a state of a communicable disease (epidemic/pandemic) where enough people from the susceptible population have become immunity-wise resistant to the disease so as to not to spread it to more venerable people of society who have weak immunity or who cannot develop immunity (Cancer patients, little children, seniors etc.). These venerable people are typically at more risk during the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this state is reached, it will end up confining the disease in small pockets of low resistance and pandemic would end as such. Reaching Herd Immunity is thus how any communicable disease will be controlled in the long run. However, how we reach herd immunity is more important than we think. There are people with crazy theories about reaching herd immunity (like injecting young healthy people with virus etc.), however, if there is one thing you should take away from this answer, it is ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Herd Immunity without vaccine is a Joke for a contagious disease‚Äù.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs say for the most contagious diseases out there like measles, if we don‚Äôt have a vaccine, how many people need to get infected before herd immunity is achieved. Answer is around 95% of the population. COVID19 is less contagious than measles (but more so than the flu) and hence around 70% of the people need to get infected for herd immunity to be achieved. Think of 70% of 1.3 Billion getting (around 900 million or 90 Crore people) sick if one wants to achieve herd immunity this way. Think of the number of people losing their lives if this happens (3% of 90 Crore is 3 Crore if you try to estimate by Indian numbers and assume that the curve would stay flattened not making the mortality ratio higher)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big assumption in the 70% population who get sick develop long term immunity. We are not sure of the fact that a person who gets cured of COVID19 is immune to the disease in the long term, heck the pandemic just started spreading few months back. ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Absence of Evidence is not Evidence of Absence‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. There were some news (not supported too scientifically) that some cured people in South Korea contracted COVID19 again. Other species of Coronavirus that cause common cold dont seem to make humans develop any long term immunity. Everyone contracts cold once or twice a year, every year. If such is the case, you cannot achieve herd immunity ever despite infecting everyone !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also don‚Äôt have any records of long term effects the COVID19 infections are causing. &lt;del&gt;It seems there are none as of now, but what if it weakens some bodily function in the long run ? 70% people weak in a country will be very bad.&lt;/del&gt; It seems many people have long term consequences even after they are cured off CoronaVirus. Think of many people in country developing these long term problems : &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devisridhar/status/1268240519227981828&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/devisridhar/status/1268240519227981828&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we race towards herd immunity blindly, it might turn out to be a disaster. We need to do more scientific research, understand whether immunity is long term / short term and accordingly we need to build onetime/recurrent vaccination regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent success of Moderna in initial vaccine trials and confidence of Indian vaccine makers, I think there is a reason to believe that India will be able to build Herd Immunity around COVID19 in maybe 12‚Äì18 months. Till then we have to take precautions and maintain social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be what helps us to build Herd Immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was written during the lockdowns, after removal of lockdowns, the rate seems to have fastened a bit. Original answer here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pNKNR5&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/pNKNR5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now (26th April 2020), I would agree that India has been able to somewhat slow the growth of COVID19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things I think which have contributed to it are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(Most if not all) People listen to government. They don‚Äôt think that government is sitting and doing nothing and they are cooperating with whatever steps government takes, despite inconveniences. You can see the support for government at very grassroot levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Indians deal with more communicable disease outbreaks than western countries due to tropical climate and high population. ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Nipah_virus_outbreak_in_Kerala&quot;&gt;2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bihar_encephalitis_outbreak&quot;&gt;2019 Bihar encephalitis outbreak ‚Äì Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; ). They were never thinking of COVID19 as ‚Äújust another flu‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lockdowns have been very effective. Except for some idiots and a few religious zealots, the country has taken social distancing carefully. Poor people have displayed real fortitude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/pNKNRS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written an extensive answer here : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-can-machine-learning-help-against-COVID-19/answer/Muktabh-Mayank&quot;&gt;Muktabh Mayank‚Äôs answer to How can machine learning help against COVID-19?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will just copy it so that you dont have to click the link :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI and Machine Learning can help in many ways against COVID 19 :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostics :&lt;/strong&gt; It can help doctors read slides, XRays , CT Scans faster by making things simpler for them by pre-categorizing scans as +, - , confusing etc. Here is a dataset to create a COVID19 detector in XRays : &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset&quot;&gt;ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;. Some relevant discussion on Fast AI : &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.fast.ai/t/notebook-covid-19-x-ray-3-7-error-rate/66557&quot;&gt;Notebook COVID-19 x-ray 3.7% error rate&lt;/a&gt;. Here is an RSNA paper to detect COVID19 from CT Scans: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200905&quot;&gt;https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200905&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triage:&lt;/strong&gt; As you know that test kits for COVID19 are a important resource. Due to this their usage is rationed and triaged. A classifier can be trained to determine whether a person showing features should be tested or kept in quarentine immediately based on the locality they live in, their day-to-day interaction with people, their closest COVID19 case and other variables. An example project here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interacademies.org/news/machine-learning-rapid-triaging-covid-19-front-door-hospitals-request-data&quot;&gt;Machine learning for rapid triaging of Covid-19 at the front door of hospitals: request for data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting:&lt;/strong&gt; Bayesian Modelling (and other Machine Learning models) can be used to forecast various effects of the pandemic. Here is some analysis by Thomas Wiecki analyzing growth. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantopian.com/posts/covid-19-growth-analysis&quot;&gt;COVID-19 Growth Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. SIR models used to model epidemics are not exactly Machine Learning, but rather simulations and differential equations, but its quite interesting to see for people interested in Maths and Data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovering Drugs and Proteins:&lt;/strong&gt; AI can help test different drugs proteins against COVID19. You might have heard of the Deepmind AlphaFold algorithm which came out a few days back: &lt;a href=&quot;https://techxplore.com/news/2020-01-alphafold-protein.html&quot;&gt;AlphaFold makes its mark in predicting protein structures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;. Its now being used to predict protein structures for COVID 19: &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/computational-predictions-of-protein-structures-associated-with-COVID-19&quot;&gt;Computational predictions of protein structures associated with COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; . Such a Just in Time discovery. Another way is using Generative AI to create new possible compounds that can fight the disease: &lt;a href=&quot;https://singularityhub.com/2017/11/19/drug-discovery-ai-to-scour-a-universe-of-molecules-for-wonder-drugs/&quot;&gt;Drug Discovery AI to Scour a Universe of Molecules for Wonder Drugs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.expresscomputer.in/news/tcs-partners-with-csir-to-design-ai-based-drug-discovery-process-for-covid-19/51647/&quot;&gt;TCS partners with CSIR to design AI based drug discovery process for COVID-19 - Express Computer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;are some relevant pieces of news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sifting Available Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Many high priority questions whose answers are needed to solve COVID19 could have already been worked on some scientists who probably don‚Äôt even know their work can save the world. This is an immense matchmaking problem. Text Mining/ Machine Learning approaches can help sift through huge research literature to find out what‚Äôs already known and can be used. There is a huge dataset on Kaggle (curated by some really serious people) where Data Scientists can participate and help discover answers : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge&quot;&gt;COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Testing:&lt;/strong&gt; A brilliant idea of doing a basic screening by recording sounds of breath may be achieved by Deep Learning. This can screen people on a smartphone, at their homes, for almost zero cost, without spending any money for procuring test kits, at whatever scale is desired. A project by NYU/FAIR to collect data has started here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breatheforscience.com/&quot;&gt;Breathe for science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 of them are in clinical trials now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What the person asking the question doesn‚Äôt understand is that unlike defense or nuclear engineering, ‚Äúindustrial‚Äù research in the world is almost never restricted by country boundaries. In fact, most research in vaccines is driven by financial incentive of making money for investors out of it. A lot of these vaccines are being developed by a collaboration of companies headquarters in different countries (and their research facilities located in sometimes countries where they are not officially from). Unlike say Socialist (Political Capitalist ?) China (whose public companies are sometimes still collaborating with other companies and countries), western Capitalism doesn‚Äôt work on National desires or needs or government policies, but, cater to simple supply-demand. Countries are incentivizing companies by making the financial outcome more lucrative at best : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/coronavirus-us-gives-astrazenena-1-billion-for-oxford-vaccine.html&quot;&gt;AstraZeneca receives $1 billion in U.S. funding for Oxford University coronavirus vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$1B, AstraZeneca must be US company right ? (Because Oxford sure as hell is not in US). &lt;strong&gt;No.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no, unlike how probably some countries (or people) might be thinking of making vaccine as a new ‚ÄúSpace Race‚Äù, its actually just a bid to make a good early bird into market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs speak about 3 promising candidate vaccines ::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above mentioned &lt;em&gt;Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine&lt;/em&gt; is one of the promising ones. It is a ‚ÄúNon-Replicating Viral Factor‚Äù, that is it doesn‚Äôt really introduce any multiplying genetic material of virus into the body but rather will teach the immune system to target other structures of the virus, like the spike protein. That is done by introducing weakened Adenoviruses (which dont cause any disease in humans) with material to produce CoronaVirus like spike proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-spike-protein-structure.html&quot;&gt;Coronavirus ‚Äòspike‚Äô protein just mapped, leading way to vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been proven to be safe for humans in first few trials and larger trials are now starting in Brazil. (The current epicenter of the disease).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-06-brazil-oxford-coronavirus-vaccine.html&quot;&gt;Brazil to help test Oxford coronavirus vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we still don‚Äôt know if medicine works. All we know is that it is safe. It doesn‚Äôt work well in monkeys and if it were an ideal world, the vaccine would not have been tested anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/potential-oxford-vaccine-fails-to-prevent-virus-spread-in-monkeys/article31617852.ece&quot;&gt;Potential Oxford vaccine fails to prevent coronavirus spread in monkeys, but protects from pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now understand probably why we need many parallel vaccine candidates. (And also understand that the most promising vaccine we have is ineffective on monkeys with COVID19 infection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderna vaccine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other vaccine which is promising is the &lt;em&gt;Moderna mrna&lt;/em&gt; based vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moderna is a US startup (or you can call it a relatively smaller public pharma company, quite tiny as compared to other big Pharma involved).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clever thing about Moderna vaccine is the technique it uses. It literally genetically engineers human cells to produce material that would trigger an immune response to COVID19 infection. (Which is done by infecting humans with a genetically engineered bacteria). The genetic material introduced into humans for producing this immune response for CoronaVirus is not actually its DNA/RNA but rather its mRNA (mitochondrial RNA). This makes sure that no replication of CoronaVirus genetic material occurs (mrna doesnt cause replication), while the immune cells learn to recognize the CoronaVirus components and kill the cells containing them. This technique is new and has never been used for any vaccine before COVID19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;The initial results (according to Moderna and Dr. Fauci) seem to be promising. [Moderna Announces Positive Interim Phase 1 Data for its mRNA Vaccine (mRNA-1273) Against Novel Coronavirus&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Moderna, Inc.](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-positive-interim-phase-1-data-its-mrna-vaccine)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that is just data that company has released. As of now, I don‚Äôt know about if they have an official publication for the results of study. That is what a lot of people are complaining about as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moderna has started its Phase 2 trials and Phase 3 trials will start in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/moderna-phaseii-vaccine-trial/&quot;&gt;Moderna starts dosing in Phase II Covid-19 vaccine trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sinovac Vaccine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now lets see about the Sinovac vaccine. Sinovac as it sounds from the name, is a Chinese public company. It has more than one candidate vaccine but there is one for which it has made some public data available. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.046375v1&quot;&gt;Rapid development of an inactivated vaccine for SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. The paper claims that SinoVac vaccine cures monkeys from COVID19, something that Oxford vaccine could not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vaccine works by first multiplying and then killing SARS-COV-2 viruses by dipping them into an organic chemical and then injecting the dead virus into humans to make immune system learn to fight COVID19. They have started clinical trials too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://covid-19.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202004/15/WS5e965bb8a3105d50a3d163de.html&quot;&gt;Three COVID-19 vaccines approved for clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vaccine is also being tried outside China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coronavirus-china-s-sinovac-biotech-in-talks-to-test-covid-19-vaccine-globally-11588937378011.html&quot;&gt;Coronavirus: China‚Äôs Sinovac Biotech in talks to test Covid-19 vaccine globally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the list of potential vaccines, there are vaccine candidates from Europe, Japan, India etc. apart from famous ones like those from US, UK, China based companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-is-hydroxychloroquine-hype-or-hope&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúIs hydroxychloroquine hype or hope?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/pNKNRd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what we know right now, HydroxyChloroquine (HCQ) is one of the most practical methods we have to prevent COVID19 in frontline workers and serious patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is some indication that it works : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102549/&quot;&gt;Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. It is actually one of the prescriptions in recommended approach to ICU management in COVID19: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600\(20\)30161-2/fulltext&quot;&gt;Intensive care management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): challenges and recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Its side effects are known. Proper trials have been done. So doctors can calculate how much of a tradeoff it is to prescribe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is cheap and can be produced in large quantities. Thus can be used by poor countries, who really have no other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Other Anti-Virals that have been proposed have similar ‚Äúnot sure if it works‚Äù results with no clinical trials and studies on side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If this question was asked in context of latest Lancet study : &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-benefit-death.html&quot;&gt;Hydroxychloroquine shows no virus benefit, raises death risk: study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image12.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Link to the study observations here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31180-6/fulltext&quot;&gt;Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19: a multinational registry analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue gathered steam and WHO paused HCQ trials and France and a few other countries stopped prescribing HCQ. (India/Brazil etc still continued the prescriptions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This study seems to have some grave issues : &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-scientists-hydroxychloroquine.html&quot;&gt;Scientists raise concern over hydroxychloroquine study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image13.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The dataset for study was not exactly public and was not from a randomized trial. After may scientists expressed concerns, Lancet actually issued doubts about the published study itself: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31290-3/fulltext&quot;&gt;Expression of concern: Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19: a multinational registry analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now, WHO trial for HCQ has been restarted (and its result is what we should believe about efficacy of HCQ) and HCQ continues to be prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-06-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trials-resume.html&quot;&gt;The Lancet doubts over hydroxychloroquine study see WHO restart trials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for now, we still dont have enough data, but given data right now, it seems HCQ is a good bet. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India‚Äôs lockdowns on the other hand were quite successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/lockdowns-may-have-averted-3-million-deaths-in-europe-by-curbing-covid-19-study/articleshow/76269187.cms&quot;&gt;Lockdowns may have averted 3 million deaths in Europe by curbing Covid-19: Study - Times of India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can generally see that India‚Äôs Corona curve had a consistently falling doubling rate due to quickly implemented lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image19.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare it to other countries like US and Italy where an immediate lockdown was not imposed. That saved many many lives, unprepared people are the most vulnerable in a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the condition is getting worse in Delhi (where most of the media is an thus reports on television have become gloomy), as of now, India seems to be recovering as a whole :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image20.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at other possible paths the curve could have taken. A strategy like Sweden would have required many-many deaths in the country before the disease could have been contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herd Immunity without vaccine is a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-is-the-indian-government-adopting-a-herd-immunity-strategy-by-easing-up-lockdown-restrictions&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúIs the Indian government adopting a herd immunity strategy by easing up lockdown restrictions?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pNKN8G&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/pNKN8G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Herd Immunity is not a practical solution : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-herd-immunity-and-how-can-it-be-effective-for-countries-like-India/answer/Muktabh-Mayank&quot;&gt;Muktabh Mayank‚Äôs answer to What is herd immunity, and how can it be effective for countries like India?&lt;/a&gt;. Herd Immunity means exposing (almost) everyone to the virus and waiting to see who comes out alive, that would be disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Indian government is trying to do is to keep the infected numbers to the minimum possible as long as a vaccine/cure is not found out. We had early lockdowns to try:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If we could just crush the curve. That is have a flattened curve in areas with virus going up. Stop movement of people and make sure the rest of the country could reopen. Eventually the hotzones would cool off too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We could produce enough PPEs, Hand Sanitizers, HCQ etc so that we can look after the sick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs what Crushing the curve is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Immediate Action&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Travel Restrictions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lockdowns&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Test + Isolate&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Wait for curve to slowly go down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof. Yaneer Bar-Yam explaining it below :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image21.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/fXUVFqKKcBM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While for countries with smaller population, 1 is easy to achieve, that is the infections can be brought down to zero just using lockdowns. it turns out for countries with large populations (We don‚Äôt know much about China, but everyone below China in population like India, Indonesia, US, Brazil, Russia‚Ä¶) the amount of lockdowns required is longer (just due to large numbers) to crush the curve altogether. So for example, a country with small population like New Zealand needs to wait lesser to crush the curve than say Indonesia. The patience of people will die after sometime and they stop supporting the lockdowns. India started seeing on-foot movement of people despite all transport disabled and UBI announcements. Public servants and representatives were afraid of lighter government coffers , businessmen became restless and people were slowly more afraid of economy tanking than the virus itself. One cannot thus continue the the lockdowns and travel restrictions. &lt;em&gt;So we are trying to have a midway approach : Reopen and try to restrict infections despite of that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have been able to do is achieve 2 well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have enough masks and sanitizers in market (remember 2 months back ?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it seems that community spread has started in Delhi and Mumbai while we have reopened these cities. Both of these cities have very high population density.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might have lockdowns in Delhi/Mumbai again while rest of the country reopens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to--is-india-successfully-flattening-the-curve-&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚Äú Is India successfully ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô? ‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Original answer here: https://qr.ae/pNCrKI&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what ‚Äúexperts‚Äù predicted at the start of the pandemic, given India‚Äôs infrastructure and capabilities, I guess Yes !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/themojostory/videos/529703107943201/&quot;&gt;‚Äú300-500 million Corona cases in India‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have lost many people, around 75,000 people by early September, but I guess we have controlled the spread as compared to what this expert believed. More about the expert here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanan_Laxminarayan&quot;&gt;Ramanan Laxminarayan - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, we had not had the worst possible outbreak. Italy for example had a spike that its health services could not manage despite having the best healthcare system as the curve was steep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first need to understand what ‚ÄúFlattening the Curve‚Äù is. (And why its one of the strategies to overcome a pandemic, but not the best). Flattening the Curve basically means to not allow disease to grow faster than how fast a country can expand its health infrastructure. India‚Äôs health infrastructure was not really capable to handle the pandemic, so we had to screw up our economics for almost a full quarter and wait for health infrastructure to grow enough to reopen and not starve people to death. Delaying the onset also means we would use clinical care practices other outbreaks would help humanity come up with. So using this definition, for sometime, India has been trying to flatten the curve only. Regular local lockdowns have been imposed if cases grew at a fast velocity in a locality and we have been trying to keep the number of cases in step with the available healthcare. The problem with flattening the curve is that you will see spike in numbers whenever you reopen and it will be an ongoing battle for a long time till a vaccine comes in or we reach herd immunity. I am writing this answer from a remote corner of Uttar Pradesh (a state not really known for its public services‚Äô diligence) and there are free testing booths on every few blocks for free testing and isolation, could not have thought of it say even 3 months back. Herd Immunity is very long drawn stupid battle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-herd-immunity-and-how-can-it-be-effective-for-countries-like-India/answer/Muktabh-Mayank&quot;&gt;Muktabh Mayank‚Äôs answer to What is herd immunity, and how can it be effective for countries like India?&lt;/a&gt; and thus India is actually batting for a vaccine. To answer your question, yes, we are trying to flatten the curve itself. Just that in most flatten the curve graphs you see, there is an assumption of health services being static and hence you see the required infected persons curve to be FLAT. This assumption was for maybe for 2‚Äì3 months for a country with a small population, not a Billion people and 3 quarters and hence you dont see ‚Äúflatness of curve‚Äù in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As of 8th September 2020, here is the curve we see: ( taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://covid19india.org/&quot;&gt;Coronavirus in India: Latest Map and Case Count&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-06-10-Observations-on-ongoing-coronavirus-pandemic/media/image26.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ok. now what is the best way to get over the pandemic ? it is ‚ÄúSmash the curve‚Äù. The austere strict sister of curve flattening. Basically lot of testing, compulsory masks and regional lockdowns before you freely reopen the economy on reaching Zero Cases. Countries with small populations and relatively richer populations have been able to pull it off like NewZealand, but its just hard to stop economic activity in a large country like US, Brazil, India etc without starving the poor and middle class. We would have liked the cases to reach Zero during lockdowns, but some orthodox religious people and other careless covidiots made us elongate the lockdowns and thus later India‚Äôs poor and businesses couldn‚Äôt bear with the lockdown reducing the efficiency. Net net, you can lockdown only for so long, because it slowly kills your economy, and India was forced to reopen without smashing the curve. The only option we have at this level of pandemic is to flatten the curve. People expecting to see zero cases probably are not understanding how the economy functions maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As of 12th October number of active cases are &lt;strong&gt;coming down&lt;/strong&gt; in India. This has been a trend for last few days. They are not going up, not at all exponentially right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DailyUpdate?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;#DailyUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19India?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;#COVID19India&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Growth rate of active cases = -1.1% &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/A1JgQwSGvh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/A1JgQwSGvh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the first wave of the pandemic in India has past its peak. Also the fatality rate of COVID19 has gone down not just in India but in the world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Case Fatality Rate - falling sharply over time - globally and in India. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2wHb9yRDqm&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/2wHb9yRDqm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Of course the best way was to just continue the restrictions for more time and let the active cases fall to Zero. &lt;a href=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e7b914b3b5f9a42199b3337/t/5ec2c0a70a471b4ca7e82122/1589821608242/9+Essential+Actions+to+%23CrushtheCurve+%28Short%29.pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just like how NewZealand/Singapore did. However, that is the good thing with relatively rich countries with small populations (and East Asian countries with high Mask compliance due to 2002 CoronaVirus outbreak: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002‚Äì2004_SARS_outbreak&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;2002‚Äì2004 SARS outbreak ‚Äì Wikipedia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ). They can restrict economy for enough time till the disease is eliminated. Most large countries on the other hand are playing the seesaw of letting people collect money by reopening for sometime and then closing back again when COVID cases rise in the process, hoping we will have a vaccine in a couple of iterations. Bill Gates thinks by next year sometime, at least the rich countries will be back to normal (if we are not super unlucky and vaccines don‚Äôt fail) :&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://7news.com.au/business/finance/bill-gates-says-rich-countries-will-be-back-to-normal-by-late-2021-c-1368831&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;Bill Gates predicts when rich countries will be ‚Äòback to normal‚Äô&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the rest of the world, India stayed close for a very long time. Europe and other cold countries where businesses need to open during summers for people to survive during summers, reopened earlier as soon as cases were declining so that the economy moves and people just don‚Äôt die starving. Economy is slightly ok for them now, but second wave of pandemic set in many parts of the world and hence you see news like this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;JUST IN: 383,359 new cases of coronavirus worldwide, the biggest daily increase since the pandemic began.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‚Äî The Spectator Index (@spectatorindex) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/spectatorindex/status/1315013401437859840?ref_src=twsrc^tfw&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;October 10, 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Indian festival season is starting and India is in a similar situation as cold countries were during the summer months. Most sales in India happen during Spetember-November season of festivals and marriage season thenceforth. If India doesn‚Äôt open up, earnings will become lesser and more and more people will be pushed towards bankruptcy. Economy is basically me and you going out and spending, that is what makes others earn and spend again and so on. Economy just vanishes in a string lockdown and many people stop making money, while expenses never stop. So its a delicate balance of 2 processes till we have a vaccine: 1. not letting too many people catch disease and 2. not letting too many people get bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerala had to reopen due to high economic activity in Onam and they are shooting up now :&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Where are NEW cases coming from? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/nkRYx5qYsG&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/nkRYx5qYsG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no clue what West Bengal is doing but the rest of the states are past their first peak (Delhi past its second peak) and they will now reopen so that people spend, make money and government fills their coffers and betters the infrastructure .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs hope that India‚Äôs mask compliance is high, social distancing is maintained and we don‚Äôt get a second wave in other parts of the country. Worst case, the reopening allows people to save and governments to build infrastructure to fight any second wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run away and don‚Äôt look back. There is going to be no use working under someone that fanatic. I am a fan of Go as a language myself, but this is a bit too much. There is no doubt a need of uniformity in the codebase and there needs to be a fixed stack, but I don‚Äôt think it is common sense to hamper productivity so much so as to start using esoteric Machine Learning frameworks in Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of working on Machine Learning, most of the time will go to try out and fight/enhance Go‚Äôs nascent Machine Learning ecosystem. While some people will love enhancing Go‚Äôs Machine Learning capabilities (I think there is a decent community), its not something every Data Scientist would want. Also as a startup there will be tight deadlines and working on places where the libraries aren‚Äôt optimized will be a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No go according to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stories like this are a norm. I‚Äôm a fresher. We‚Äôve a large code base running for over two years. I was told to implement an interface which was committed over a year - and there was no documentation at all. I asked about the functioning of the individual methods to which I got a reply that I ought to look at examples where it is implemented.&lt;br /&gt;
Is it normal? Does everyone have to read un-commented code for hours while the person who‚Äôs originally written it could explain it in five minutes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of startups dont have formal documentation, but that doesnt mean young employees are left on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 subquestions you asked :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it normal?&lt;br /&gt;
No. This shows poor engineering standards of the company. Your PM and Lead are not doing their job well. Most companies either have documentation or KT (knowledge Transfer sessions) before a new Engineer takes over the job&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does everyone have to read un-commented code for hours while the person who‚Äôs originally written it could explain it in five minutes?&lt;br /&gt;
After they are given an overview of the project, people sometimes do need to read undocumented code, but there needs to be someone whom they can approach for guidance. Maybe their lead or a senior developer in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should my approach be?&lt;br /&gt;
Run. All I can understand is that the company you work in wants you to be a code monkey. Do you think such mess of code can ever scale ? If you want to be a good engineer, join a place which has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; engineering practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally Answered Here: &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/pNnZOV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk to your employer and understand what timelines they have in terms of promoting you/giving you a raise. You need to understand how your company is doing. There are many possible scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is no reason your employer cannot give you (justified) raise pending from a long time if your company is doing good. They are just bad people to work for if they reject a genuine raise in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the company is not doing well and you are learning a lot at your work, you need to understand what is the marginal gain in learning (I understand that workplaces with uncertain futures are great learning experiences) as compared to a stable salary you are being offered somewhere else. Are they allowing you to cash out on your learning by generating your own client interface/networks or publishing papers/blogs/patents ? Remember, just learning isn‚Äôt enough, putting it out there also is. You need to understand till what level you want to continue learning (Specialization is a field only pays off for a certain level).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the company is not doing too well and you feel it will get better, you are sharing the risk of the company. In that case, you should ask for share in gains as well (equity, promised bonuses etc.). Set a timeline till when you will wait for the company to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The fourth scenario where the company is not doing well and you dont expect it to rebound, quit. They would have fired you if they did not see you get better, they might give you a pink slip to cut losses in future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(My startup is not based out of Bangalore, so you can consider this as a third party opinion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How startups work and how people outside might visualize them is maybe very different. Most people who don‚Äôt know a startup inside out, relate them more to the large companies like Infosys, Google, Amazon etc. (and now probably Flipkart, Ola ?) , which they are more familiar with .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any startup‚Äôs ideal employees are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Self taught (or slightly experienced) beginners (not novices) who will be able to take low salaries an deliver tasks assigned to them. The work culture is flexible, so fitting in doesn‚Äôt matter, people have to deliver that‚Äôs all. (Entry Level)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Smart people who are willing to compensated by equity instead of salary and can lead employees like 1 (above) into building something that scales and can raise money. (Senior)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large company‚Äôs ideal employees are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Non-Experienced people/novices who can join and learn the company‚Äôs work culture and methodology and learn skills to deliver accordingly. Company can afford to spend good money here and sometime novices in big companies are better paid than beginners in startups. (Entry Level)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Then hierarchy wise the company has various openings with high salaries where they acquire senior people, including even the C-suite. (Senior Positions)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from salaries (which are typically low cash + high equity in startups and high cash + low equity in large companies), there is a second difference at the entry level hirings : Startups need people who have somewhat a non-zero level (beginner &amp;gt; novice, a beginner for example will be able to write a simple web service in Python, while a novice will just know Python syntax) of knowledge and can learn on the job, large companies prefer novices whom they can train in their own efficient way. Remember startups are optimized for speed, large companies for efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt be willing to work for free, try to get to a level where you can get an entry level job is what I will recommend if you want to work in a startup. It is not that hard; do a couple of online courses, don‚Äôt pay, just audit or just read good books and get yourself slightly above the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way can be , take a novice level job (given you are a novice and not a beginner) in a large company where you are getting the profile you want and get some experience by their training. You can join a startup later if you don‚Äôt find their culture good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are beginner/advanced beginner who is applying to work in startups for free and not getting calls, improve your medium (switch to Hasgeek/AngelList etc) , because this is not really possible if you are doing it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One or both out of two reasons :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To look desirable&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To take advantage of arbitrage a new field creates&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both these are quite related. Humans find people who take advantage of new techniques desirable probably because they have been more successful along evolution. An ape that used a piece of Iron to kill a larger mammoth would have become leader of its tribe, people who discovered gunpowder built huge empires and amassed riches. Many of us try doing new cool things just to look more desirable (without understanding that we are also trying to play a game of arbitrage beneath the hood as taught by evolution) as just looking desirable feels like a good enough reward to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is arbitrage in learning something new ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Its harder to reach at the top in a competitive field with strong competitors. Lets ask a simple question, ‚ÄúIs it easier to get into football team of your school or into the curling team of your school ? (Example taken understanding most people in India wont even know what curling is)‚Äù. If you have a hint that with some probability curling is going to go big in next few years (arbitrage 1), you can try to cash in this knowledge to become leader in curling when no one is interested into it. Then, when later curling rises in probability, you will get asymmetric benefits despite how skilled you are at it. A mediocre early bird player is probably as well known as a excellent curling player who joins later. It is a bet to put ones faith in a new field, that will give better results than pure meritocracy in a new upcoming fields to early adopters if the new field picks up, but might be a waste of time and resources if the field fizzles out. The phenomenon is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;Preferential attachment ‚Äì Wikipedia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Many people will try to gain fortunes if a new field starts becoming popular. The demand for expertise goes up by a lot. Supply of talent will take a lot of time to catch up as not everyone has time and money to learn new arts, yielding immense financial rewards for early experts (arbitrage 2). If you specialize in such a new field, you can make use of it to earn much more than what you would deserve in a normalized playing field. The phenomenon is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortage&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;Shortage ‚Äì Wikipedia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Older fields also make you compete against more senior people. Senior people are more adverse to change and will try not to jump into new fields. If you get into an old field, you have to compete with people who are much more experienced and have cumulative knowledge gathered for really long, so an experienced person of same caliber as you will be quite ahead of you. That is way harder than competing on a level playing field. There is also the phenomenon of gate keeping. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeping_\(education\)&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;Gatekeeping (education) - Wikipedia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to summarize you can earn lot of money in both old and new fields, but its easier to get lucky in a new field. So its way harder to reach near top of hierarchy in an older more established field. In a newer field, you can earn more when normalized by your caliber and your experience.

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to clarify some common fears people have around AI eating their jobs in my Quora answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-artificial-intelligence-will-or-may-lead-to-an-unanticipated-crisis-if-it-starts-to-code-itself-how-true-is-it&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúArtificial intelligence will or may lead to an unanticipated crisis if it starts to code itself? How true is it?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/TSC6dR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chill!! People who are asking such questions need to first of all stop worrying and stop reading media articles trying to scare them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are decades (maybe centuries) away from totally automating tasks which require such high level of mental capability. Present Artificial Intelligence can at best approximate tasks which require 2‚Äì3 seconds of human decision making that is all. Also most AI we have developed right now is not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence&quot;&gt;Artificial general intelligence - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(the one which you watch on movies) but task specific algorithms. We have not even created Terminator/Skynet 0.0.1 yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer your question directly, it might be a problem (with some low probability) if AI starts implementing a better AI itself, thus increasing its capability at a superhuman rate making humans obsolete. But this is like hundreds of other low probability doomsday scenarios like an Alien civilization attacking and colonizing us or Earth‚Äôs capability to support life getting over. So no point worrying about it in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-what-is-deepfake-technology&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúWhat is Deepfake technology?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/pNnxiL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deepfake is essentially creating fake images/videos/audio/text using Deep Learning techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you remember a recent viral app which used to create images of how a person would look if they were old or applied makeup, the images it was creating were fake images generated by AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the term ‚ÄúDeepfake‚Äù is generally used for describing negative usage of such technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can have someone‚Äôs face placed in an objectionable photograph, someone being made to speak fake things they never said in a video and a fake audio in someone‚Äôs voice or just a fake news article using Generative Deep Learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example there are websites where objectionable videos of celebrities are created by morphing their faces into existing pornography using Deep Learning. There is also danger of a video being made with a politician being made to say something that they have not using such technology to sway the public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn‚Äôt that such fake photographs or videos or audio cannot be created by humans. They can be and have been created in the past and even now. Just that Deep Learning algorithms bring ‚Äúautomation‚Äù to it, that is they can now be created in large quantities without human involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will put some examples here which you can see and understand how AI can generate video/image/text samples :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-should-we-be-worried-about-deep-fakes-and-the-misuse-of-facial-recognition&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúShould we be worried about deep fakes and the misuse of facial recognition?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/Tx6CUl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the only aspect of Artificial Intelligence that can disrupt our world for a very long time to come is going to be DeepFakes. The reason is not because the technology is itself very harmful, the reason is because humans are emotional and don‚Äôt really put a thought before believing and sharing videos or voice messages. You could basically generate photos , videos and voice clips of a person doing/saying whatever you want using these techniques. I will not be surprised if fake media created by these technology be used to instigate violence or bad faith. In a world where fake news is widespread and fake news busters can spread fake news too, it is going to be big challenge to tackle Deepfakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The misuse of facial recognition is actually somewhat fearmongering and ludditism. It probably makes the world somewhat less private, but every technology since the invention of cameras has done so for a very long time and its a continuing trend since years. I think the probability of using Face Recognition for bad purposes is not that high. That said, I think there are already regulations in place in various countries to make sure Facial Recognition cannot be used to harm people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many assumptions in the question appear wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Deepmind is a company, its not an AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is a theoretical future where computers can learn any new task when presented to them like humans, is decades if not centuries away. Weak AI means a Computer needs to be programmed to perform one task, like detecting cavity in teeth or playing Atari games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- end list --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Weak AI variant for problems like ‚Äú1 + 1 + 1 ‚Ä¶ ‚Äú exists. That is simple mathematical expression parsing and evaluation. What Deepmind was trying to do was to use a Weak AI model generally used to look for features in language (LSTMs are the algorithm) to solve mathematical problems. All it tells is Weak AI algorithms to extract features on Natural Language cannot learn to solve Mathematical problem as of now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so called Data Scientists who use off the shelf Machine Learning algorithms on simple data WILL be automated pretty soon, infact Amazon/Azure/Google ML services already do so. To be frank, calling sklearn.fit_predict with different parameters is not really hard and is kind of repetitive.&lt;br /&gt;
The real world is slightly different, A lot of real world Data Scientists are actually Data Mungers, who clean/transform the data (which is really hard to automate), and then Hyperparameter adjusters who apply black box algorithms on top of it (which is easy to automate).&lt;br /&gt;
Other easy repetitive tasks, which involve simple repetitive work and involve humans for the hack of it (say Data Entry Operators, Customer Support chat people, ) are being automated at a steep rate too. Surprisingly, some aspects of art (some form of painting, music, lyrics writing) is being automated too, which I thought was impossible to.&lt;br /&gt;
The day to day tasks of actual Data Scientists, say working at Facebook AI research and Google Brain (writing different Artificial Intelligence agents) will be one of the last to be automated, as it is generally very hard. So I think they will be one of the last in last in the¬† line of losing ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest‚Äù battle to Machines. A time when Machine can deduce algorithms is still far off in future.&lt;/p&gt;

What will humans do in the future?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link to original answer here: https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-need-for-humans-if-we-automate-everything-with-machine-learning-and-robotics-What-will-humans-do-in-the-future/answer/Muktabh-Mayank&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it necessary for humans to work ? Do any other species of plants and animals work jobs ? Don‚Äôt other species live ? Is the only purpose of human existence to make Excel and Powerpoint sheets or write Python code ? These are deep metaphysical questions which are more philosophical and have no real (only theoretical ) answers. Also this is not my answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more practical answer is that automation has always been coming, jobs have always been automated. Shoe Makers were automated by factories and chariot drivers and horse tamers were automated by cars. What always happens is new jobs were created every time (factory workers, car drivers) requiring lesser number of humans, so that humans could engage in more intellectually demanding fields. The same is happening now, with incoming AI technology, jobs are changing. The difference is that while it took generations earlier for a change to reflect, people will see drastic changes in their lifetime (that‚Äôs probably the only challenge I see, people will not really be able to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù on a career for all their lives pretty soon and will require to learn-unlearn many times in their lifetime) . &lt;strong&gt;The (wrongful) fear is because we see only one aspect of it, not the other side. AI does automate stuff, but sum of human achievements is not a Zero Sum game, it will grow larger.&lt;/strong&gt; While you might not be required to enter data in Excel (one random example) searching web due to AI, a bigger intellectual challenge can be taken over by same person than Excel data entry (like say solving Cancer).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes. (2025 is not the date I think its going to happen, but its inevitable and will happen in near future). They will be to a good extent. So will be Software Developers, designers, manual workers, teachers, linguists, musicians, game developers etc,etc. There are already rudimentary projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.floydhub.com/turning-design-mockups-into-code-with-deep-learning/&quot;&gt;Turning Design Mockups Into Code With Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt; which can turn a design mockup into HTML/CSS code, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carpedm20/ENAS-pytorch&quot;&gt;carpedm20/ENAS-pytorch&lt;/a&gt; which can design neural networks without a Data Scientist, &lt;a href=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why AutoML Is Set To Become The Future Of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; , system which can generate new characters for games, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.business-standard.com/article/international/microsoft-ai-can-translate-chinese-to-english-just-as-accurately-as-humans-118031500414_1.html&quot;&gt;Microsoft AI can translate Chinese to English just as accurately as humans&lt;/a&gt; , [Baidu‚Äôs Deep Voice can clone speech with less than four seconds of training&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the artificially drawn faces by latest GANs , designers will find it harder to compete with the new quality. https://youtu.be/XOxxPcy5Gr4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-05-23-Replies-To-Questions-On-AI-Ludditism/media/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI will impact every job profile which exists as of now, Data Scientists no exception, automating some or a lot of work people spend their time on. For a lot of time these systems will become a &amp;lt;Man + Machine&amp;gt; AI systems rather than just a Human working before stuff is totally automated. So its not like everyone becomes redundant day 1, but they will eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full Automation of any field is going to take way longer than 2025 IMHO. That said, yes a lot less people will be needed for the same task as of today. Then what will people do you ask ? newer more complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation is not a new phenomenon. Think about the railway breaks a long time back: https://youtu.be/EEUkmP2nyxo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-05-23-Replies-To-Questions-On-AI-Ludditism/media/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much work was once needed to just stop the train. A lot lesser work is needed today to run/stop the train and not just that, slowly trains are moving towards full automation, but right now they are in a &amp;lt;man + machine&amp;gt; stage. A lot of jobs will stay in this phase for sometime before full automation kicks in. But unlike railways, which take generations to move from one stage of automation to another, AI is causing changes at a phase at a very high rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the effect on a general Data Scientist (or any white/blue collared worker for that matter):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Adapt to AI. Automation has started, but AI aided jobs will stay for a few more years than non-AI jobs. So while no plain X jobs by 2025, X + AI jobs might be around till 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Things wont be like earlier generations where one skill learnt gets you a job for entire life. One needs to be open to learning new skills and get started in the middle of life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Average level of education needed will be high. Think of it, 50 years back ‚ÄúHigh School‚Äù was all the education needed for most jobs. Now its somewhere between high school and graduation. Masters and Research might look like the next frontier, but these degrees are too slow and broad. Coursera like courses will become more important in catching new skillsets. You might already see people doing that a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;With more uncertainty in jobs, millenials probably will want to be a less ‚Äúspend-y‚Äù and more frugal. You can see things happening already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.in/6-reasons-why-more-millennials-arent-buying-homes/articleshow/59005530.cms&quot;&gt;6 reasons why more millennials aren‚Äôt buying homes&lt;/a&gt; and will actually increase. AI is just a trend in a longer cycle of Automation and millenials are at a point in history where education+society was according to old norms but automation has reached a point where jobs have become uncertain. Younger people will be smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-should-facial-recognition-technology-be-banned-considering-it-can-do-more-harm-than-good&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúShould facial recognition technology be banned considering it can do more harm than good?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIt can do more harm than good.‚Äù How is this proven ? This is just a subjective opinion. If we were to make regulations on subjective opinions, we would ban many things just because people thought they are bad. Unfortunately, Humans do react to emotionally and based on opinions. we have regulated away (or are trying to regulate away) innovation in fields which can potentially solve the biggest problems the world is facing right now, because we were made to emotionally believe that the fields are bad, just like how the OP thinks about Facial Recognition today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give some examples :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Research in Nuclear Engineering and making reactors has been sidelined and demonized so much that very less innovation than expected has happened in these fields. We could have by now potentially removed all polluting coal power if we would have innovated well and global warming would not have been an issue maybe. But no, because people are made to believe that Nuclear power itself is bad, our democratic institutions have neglected this field. There is no doubt about the fact that Nuclear reactors malfunctioned in past and there were nuclear weapons. The correct way should have been to promote Nuclear technology that is less risky and cannot be weaponized. But that would not have struck a chord with the armchair smart people that run the world as its a boring pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs not the only thing. We have to feed everyone in the world and we are willing to promote insects as a potential protein source than promoting work on GMOs. The most sensible solution would have been to estimate what is the total capacity of Earth to sustain human population and check the rise accordingly. Dont push something you don‚Äôt know the response of. We don‚Äôt do so, because that disregards human freedom and also would lower the return on our financial investments. When we don‚Äôt understand how to feed these new people we would either build a class exploitation theory (which is not entirely wrong, but that‚Äôs not the only reason) or just ask them to eat insects for protein. A better way to solve this would be by making more resistant crops using GMOs. Genetic Modifications is something humans have been anyway doing by force breeding plants and animals, but in a slow long term way. All technology enables us to do is to make the process faster. Of course, no one is denying potential risks of GMOs and we should regulate GMOs for these, but building a culture and opinion around ‚Äúorganic food‚Äù and demonizing them completely is not what would be sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Things still move in background but very slowly for these two and many such fields which common public feel the fields are bad because their security is threatened. There is no doubt that regulation is needed to protect public security, but banning fields of science and demonizing them are modern equivalents to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning&quot;&gt;Book burning - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Stupid and Luddite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let‚Äôs come to the current question. ‚ÄúShould Face Recognition be banned altogether ?‚Äù .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Can you guarantee that banning it would stop government and people in power snooping on innocent people ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Can you guarantee that all the lives Face Recognition surveillance saves from terrorists and wrong doers will still be saved ? If no, are the potential lives saved by this technology of lesser importance than your own life ? Why should they go to waste ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All AI phrenology is snake oil. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology&quot;&gt;Phrenology - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- end list --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;. AI to determine the right candidate for the job, AI to determine gender/sexual orientation, AI to determine criminal action. All these fields are snake oil from what I understand. So if you are making this as a case against Facial Recognition, you are reading one or both out of hyped up media and bad research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt that there are potential wrongdoings that Facial Recognition can be used for. Stopping that by regulations is why we elect people into parliaments and legislatures. I really like how the cigarette companies are required to put photos of the potential bad effects of their products on packets by regulation, fantastic trick of regulation. There is then gatekeeping regulation with thick red tape so that only big firms with lawyers can deal with. That is another way how the negative hype can be used to restrict innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There should be restriction of bad practices. But if people force them to take stupid book burning decisions, we are destined to not cross the great filter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter&quot;&gt;Great Filter - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this answer feels wrong and boring, that is how most real world issues are : &lt;strong&gt;Complex&lt;/strong&gt; and not solvable with one line blanket statements like : ‚ÄúBan X‚Äù and ‚ÄúF**K Y‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-is-it-true-that-artificial-intelligence-will-eat-70-jobs-in-india-by-2025-i-feel-so-much-scared-my-brother-is-in-it--i-am-in-the-back-office-for-livelihood&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúIs it true that artificial intelligence will eat 70% jobs in India by 2025? I feel so much scared. My brother is in IT &amp;amp; I am in the back office for livelihood.‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/pN2YLH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion 1:&lt;/strong&gt; I dont think 70% of the jobs right now will be automated by 2025. Maybe by 2035 I guess or even later. It‚Äôs too soon to worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion 2:&lt;/strong&gt; AI eating away 70% of the jobs (whenever that happens, say 2030) doesnt mean that 70% people will be unemployed. What a lot of scaremongers do not tell you is that ‚Äúold jobs going away‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚ÄúNo new jobs will be created‚Äù, causing the panic I can sense in your question. Also the change will not be quick like CoronaVirus pandemic, it will be gradual and will give you time to adapt. If you are worried that a Terminator army will one day come swooping over taking away our jobs, that day is maybe impossible or far far away in future and shouldn‚Äôt happen in your lifetime I guess. What at best will happen by 2030 according to me is AI being used as a tool in most jobs around the world just like Computers are right now. So you will have to take courses to adapt maybe to a new type of work profile where your work is aided by AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion 3:&lt;/strong&gt; The only thing constant in this world is ‚Äúchange‚Äù. Things will not be constant. Your job changes from year to year. Maybe you started working with a Windows system and then the company adapted to Linux and you just did fine. You are evolved as a human as pinnacle of life forms on Earth out of millions of years of life just to make sure you are sturdy enough to adapt to change. See, you have already lived through high pollution (guessing you live in a metropolitan in India) and 7 months of CoronaVirus, did you fear it and prepare for it when you were young ? No, and still you did fine. You might do just fine even if there is a sudden event like alien invasion and make a way for yourself, much better in a gradual change like adoption of AI, dont stress too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Do we work on the same jobs as our grandfathers did ? One of my grandparents was given a scholarship and a government job guarantee to study veterinary sciences. There was so much demand and not enough supply. Is there the same requirement for veterinary doctors today ? No. There is a requirement for something today and that is going to shift. Because humanity is growing at a super-exponential speed, jobs used to get redundant in a few generations for our ancestors, they will get redundant a few times in a human lifetime for millenials and future generations. That is the cost we pay for super fast internet speed and healthcare getting better by the day and cars that don‚Äôt need to drive. However, none of these changes we see happening have brought massive unemployment, I don‚Äôt think AI adoption will do that either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some big company stops using one BI solution (say X BI) and decides to switch to a competitor can create a decent job risk for someone working as an X BI expert (that‚Äôs the type of titles you see) in Indian IT firms. Think of AI as a similar risk, you can face maybe a small break at work at worse, but it wont just make number of jobs in market as Zero (or even scarce). How do you avoid these risks : A. Save, don‚Äôt spend like crazy. B. Insure and build a safety net. C. Be ready to upskill and D. Build redundancy in income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-is-it-possible-that-the-level-of-artificial-intelligence-we-have-today-be-capable-to-manipulate-humans-and-their-behaviour&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúIs it possible that the level of artificial intelligence we have today, be capable to manipulate humans and their behaviour?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here : https://qr.ae/pN2a7U&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI algorithms (as of today) themselves are not capable enought to manipulate humans. So basically no AI algorithm can really by its own mind creep into social media and try influencing human behaviour. No Skynet yet, maybe for not a very long time in future. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_\(Terminator\)&quot;&gt;Skynet (Terminator) - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, what current AI algorithms can do is automate tasks that humans take a few seconds to do. Basically get a rough look at your web history and understand what are your general interests or looking at a video and keeping of track of what persons appeared in it or searching information related to a term in search engine. These are trivial tasks, but an AI algorithm performing them can vastly reduce effort for people who want to influence someone‚Äôs personal touch on issue. That is because a personal ‚Äúnudge‚Äù can be given to a person on an issue (what baby diaper to buy, what car to buy or what party to vote for) only after processing a lot of information about them. What AI algorithms can enable is massive information processing about different people. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism&quot;&gt;Surveillance capitalism - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, if you really think that humans have not been led by a few before AI‚Äôs invention and this is something of a new dystopian phenomenon, you probably need to understand the entire business of mainstream media (MSM, for purpose of this answer MSM = TV + newspapers + Movies + Other non-scientific Publications, some scientific ones even) and advertisement better. Behavior of humans in a society is controlled by creation of a ‚Äúwindow of discourse‚Äù by mainstream media using emotive cognition and limited handouts (That basically means cleverly creating good and bad images about things and focusing majority of discussion on less important things). Most people dont really know what they want and so they are made to want things which satisfy them and also helps the people who are putting resources to influence them. Humans are not actually as rational and smart as what economics classes teach us. This phenomenon has been alive since Indus Valley, Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. Initially the power was held by clergy, then marketing executives and media professionals, and they still continue to hold some of the power, but internet is the new gangsta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What AI enables in combination with internet is instead of influencing the group think by controlling the narrative, personal information of people can be analyzed to shape their personal world view. This effects humans more deeply. A lot of us now think very differently from what the MSM wants us to think due to these modern ways to influence opinion (So for example, MSM continues selling us soft drinks as feel good happy drinks which popular sports people drink, but many many people are not drinking these now). This personal touch can enable sale of products and maybe even effect your views on nuclear energy, solar energy, global warming, free college or even any new faith or MSM outlet, things which had absolute control on such influence earlier. As you can see, this is much more powerful than old groupthink control mechanism employed by Mainstream Media like movies, televisions and newspapers and that is why they create a lot of noise criticizing it. Its effecting revenues and influence of erstwhile influencers and they dont like that a lot. No surprises about the dystopian hit pieces around ‚ÄúAI is coming for you‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial media needs to be controlled‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are even 1% tensed or worried about this, you first need to ask yourself : What is society ? Isnt it animals whose behavior is controlled by some narrative ? Its just a debate about who runs the narrative, who sits on top of the pyramid, that is all, no big deal for most of us followers. Chill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to self : Dont rewatch Black Mirror for the third time :-D .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-will-the-5g-internet-or-asi-make-this-world-a-chaotic-place&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúWill the 5G internet (or ASI) make this world a chaotic place?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally Answered here: https://qr.ae/pNCZvk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume the question is asked on the premise that with such humongous data speed available to each person, will society get out of control as hierarchy/order will be hard to maintain ? I dont foresee any other way 5G can harm, as its not going to be rolled out without tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The correct theoretical answer to this is : We dont know. But probability of chaos prevailing due to 5G is quite very less given that humanity is quite tenacious. Why so ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can think of human world as a very large self-organizing system. Any system which is isolated tends to have high entropy over time. I am not talking about the more popular thermodynamic entropy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_\(classical_thermodynamics\)&quot;&gt;Entropy (classical thermodynamics) - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;) here but the probabilistic concept of entropy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_\(information_theory\)&quot;&gt;Entropy (information theory) - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which simply means that the more new variables you introduce into the system, the shock or surprise value of the system increases. Just by existing, humanity is creating new issues which can surprise and damage it. We are also adding more variables with the resources of Earth we consume or the human population increase. Also with every new technology we add into the system (AI / blockchain / 5G / Genetic Engineering), while you add a few ways for the system to grow, you add many more possible ways for the system to fail. A self-organizing system will either adapt or evolve around a new surprise to incorporate it. However, if the change is something that overwhelms its capacity to adapt or evolve, it will get destroyed. Such irreversible changes are called systemic risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a technology like 5G (or ASI) is not a systemic risk, that is 5G can be rolled out gradually and problems it causes can be addressed along the way. Humanity is a self-organizing system, so it will roll out a new technology incrementally and use active stability (tactical measures) to avoid pitfalls and not crash and burn when the technology is being introduced. In simpler terms, humans are adaptable and will slowly adapt to incremental technologies and circumstances. You can say the same for new technologies like genetics or AI. The only problems are systemic risks (like pandemics, say COVID19, or say asteroid hitting the Earth), which cannot be paused and will overwhelm the speed at which humans adapt. These can damage or destabilize system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another path technology luddites suggest is to not take any risks at all, that is make surprise factor as zero from technology, invent no technology. That would essentially make the system implode as you are adding new issues and people all the time and society (and nature) can only bear as many people in its natural state. You need technology to adapt the society for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other people who propose restrictions on new technology actually believe in passive stability (plan everything beforehand and create regulations/controls to avoid failures). They are mostly wrong as they cannot imagine all possible scenarios and end up creating regulatory capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paraphrasing Jordan B Peterson from his book, ‚Äúthe path to progress lies in between stability and chaos‚Äù. Too much stability (not inventing new technology, too much restriction on thoughts and movements) will create chaos as system crashes under its own weight. 5G is a risk, but not a systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5G internet is an incremental change. There is no doubt about the fact it will introduce changes into the system, but you will always have the option to turn it off. With new information available, humans will realign and the humanity as a system can adapt or evolve, but its rare that humans will not be able to take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More practically, what changes did the transition from 3G to 4G bring ? You can kind of extend the arrow and predict what changes will 5G technology bring. More apps and more centralized data over the internet. A lot many things we cannot even imagine right now. That said, I personally find it hard to believe that faster internet can damage humanity. In many places, the data speed change between 3G and 4G is not even that high to notice and maybe even after 5G is rolled out, many people will get data speed of 4G levels only for a long time. So it might actually even turn out to be marketing gimmick in some circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many AI algorithms Google has launched as products. Remember they all are Artificial Special Intelligence algorithms that can do one task only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Translate is an AI algorithm that translates text from one language to other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Assistant is an AI algorithm that translates sound to text and then performs a Google Search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Photos has an AI algorithm that automatically categorizes your photos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GMail has an AI algorithm that suggests text so that you need to type less&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YouTube has an AI algorithm that recommends you good videos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a few more..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont want you to think the following two things :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Google has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence&quot;&gt;Artificial general intelligence - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-how-can-you-define-the-indian-startup-economy&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúHow can you define the Indian startup economy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally Answered Here: https://qr.ae/TDM7li&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is in a unique position demographically and economically to create many different types of companies. This demographic dividend of youth creates unique opportunities :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;India‚Äôs cost of living is low, so you can still get relatively better talent at a certain wage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;India‚Äôs population is growing and many people are entering into the workforce. Given these people are trained well, a supply-demand gap will not arise for certain time period and hence wages will remain relatively stable for a long time time to come. This makes sure doing more and more innovation doesn‚Äôt get costlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Indian government is no longer a Soviet style planned, capitalists-are-pig preaching economy. Same with people, people no longer wanted to work in stagnant government jobs where hard work had no rewards and the most optimal behavior was to work just enough to not get into trouble, but rather to make money with hard work and enjoy their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That said, a lot of these people will start getting good wages making a larger middle class. This creates a larger market where you can sell goods and services making more people get good wages and increasing the market even more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great opportunity, with a window between years 1990‚Äì2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While initially we let large companies come to India and use India as a talent pool (and market) for a very long time (when I completed my engineering in 2012 at BITS Pilani, working for a large multinational was the top choice, most of my batchmates work for a multinational in India or abroad), giving employment to a certain number of people creating a primary new middle class, we cannot hope to sustain our growing population with these multinationals who bring only selected jobs here. The first middle class we created with this capitalist boom of 1990s and 2000s also created a stronger demand (market) for goods and services and created a talent pool. This can do wonders .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs see what happened when there was no startup economy in India. A very good period to think about this was the 2000s. We already had a middle class who believed in neoliberalism/globalism very strongly and we were using American products like there is no tomorrow. Think of it, no big search engines, social networks, Electronic manifactures and Mobile OS came out of India, None. We were really happy using Symbian, Orkut, Facebook and others. Think of the amount of technical expertise and talent pool these companies would have created if India had its own Baidu, Yandex, Android or Xiaomi. This would have created way more startups and jobs and market than what we have right now. &lt;em&gt;We missed out !&lt;/em&gt; Governments did not have confidence to put policies in place which could help benefit our ecosystem or they maybe did not realize the power of ecosystems and economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian Entrepreneurs of 2000s and early 2010s had to prove their mettle by sweat and blood. They proved that companies could be built in India, large ones. Zoho, Infoedge, Freshworks, Flipkart, PayTM, SnapDeal and startups of that generation deserve respect just for standing up and building up a company. That is what gave confidence to government that Indians can build large companies and confidence of next generation of entrepreneurs that its possible to make it big with some risks and made people believe they can spend money on an Indian website or app. The fellows and contemporaries of these entrepreneurs who saw their success came back from their high paid multinational jobs to join the startup ecosystem and the story began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we serve our own market, we create an ecosystem:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let‚Äôs see what happened when we have an startup ecosystem (my preferred term instead of startup economy). Any technology trend has 3 steps -&amp;gt; 1. Early Developments , 2. Growth and 3. Consolidation. With our startup system maturing, we still haven‚Äôt reached the level of doing Early Developments of technology trends (say food tech, coworking, ride hailing, O2O etc did not start in India but still in US and China), but already at growth stage we can build companies which can cater to our markets specifically. This adds new bigger startups to our ecosystem all the time. These bring in new talent that is economically powerful that can drive the next wave building even larger startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In first wave of startups like Search Engines and Social Networks we were so behind that had no Indian companies, in the next wave like ride hailing and e-commerce, we had an Indian counterpart racing with a foreign high-growth startup from outside (Flipart/OLA) and in the next step, we have all Indian companies in fintech and hotel space and foodtech (Oyo / PayTM / Swiggy and Zomato/ so many lending startups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have not mentioned, we are progressing very fast in not a very long duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How this contributes to building better ecosystem ? While operational jobs will always be in India for an Indian and Foreign company, that is foreigners will seldom deliver food in India, high worth and innovative jobs come to India with Indian companies. For example, way higher ratio of product managers of an Indian startup will sit in India than product managers of Foreign startups. This adds way more to ecosystem as for the next innovation India will be more prepared and maybe Indian ecosystem is so early to some technology trend that we have our own google in that space. The other thing is that these high innovative individuals earn much more and create a more powerful market than just operational people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also see the progress in technology development too. I consider Infosys to be the first successful Indian startup in software. From primarily deploying software as to how old software companies of India worked to making cheaper variants of successful software products, I think we are soon going to see the next break through where Indian Software startups which dominate by their innovation will emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation follows large businesses and ecosystem that can invest in them:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once there is demand and market (people willing to adapt and government not-interfering or better helping) and supply (a talent pool that can build services that can cater to demand), economics happens. In 2000s, There was high respect of ‚Äúmultinationals‚Äù in India and people wanted to buy/use their products, this created a huge market for multinational corporations in India and frankly, they are monopolies in India, even bigger market shares than in their own companies. Think about Google, Facebook, Suzuki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, look at the long term repercussions. I will talk about software because I know the space well. India still doesn‚Äôt know widely how to build Server Farms, hugely scalable software tools (have you heard of an Indian mapreduce ? an Indian Golang ? Indian Tensorflow ?), despite giving an opportunity to scale these companies so much. These companies now have so much edge that probably any Indian Search Engine / Social Media innovation at best will be a copy and be months if not years behind in tech due to lack of ecosystem. A lot of these tools have their parallel in China and Russia which have their own ecosystems. Not saying that using non-tensorflow is a must, but knowledge of building tensorflow-like failed software also helps drive next step of innovation. That knowledge needs to stay in ecosystem. India had no ecosystem, so no one stayed back which created a bad image and lead to further brain drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High innovation thing like say building a Tensorflow requires a very very strong pre-existing business that can take load of R\&amp;amp;D on top of their nominal business. Only old very successful companies can do it. They will hence create an advantage which is very strong and that cannot be taken away from them. Moat is the terms startups have for it. Tensorflow innovations will slowly make companies using the tool migrate to Google cloud just by the features. This is going to be a big business for Google in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our companies will be able to do it locally after they grow really big and are able to attract our top talent to stay and in fact bring top talent from outside. Again, all this top talent, will be very highly paid and will spend their money in the country, making our economy bigger. Operational jobs are never going anywhere too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why some people don‚Äôt like startup risks and prefer the older ‚Äúsafer‚Äù way :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I observed this trend in other answer to the question and thus am adding this heading which is not really relevant to the question)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well because the old multinational way, a few people of India got employment in large stable multi national companies which were expanding. A small set of relatively safer jobs were created. A company in early phases of a technology trend has more jobs, but these are more volatile. So a section of people who would have the advantage of the safer jobs of multinational might not like more volumes of higher-uncertainty jobs getting created. We have to leave this Soviet style mentality behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-why-are-huge-indian-tech-startups-bleeding-losses&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúWhy are huge Indian tech startups bleeding losses?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally Answered Here: https://qr.ae/TleOX5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they are not meant to make profits in their initial days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian media (and self anointed experts most people listen to) is quite old fashioned about running a company and still tries to put everything in perspective of the 1990s, the world has moved beyond that to what I now call the ‚ÄúAmazon model‚Äù. Other companies which have similar approaches are FaceBook, Uber, Turo, AirBnB, (Indian startups which you are probably talking about in question -&amp;gt; ) Oyo, Swiggy, Zomato and so on. ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù answers like ‚Äúthey are not innovative enough‚Äù I see here have to understand some of the world‚Äôs largest companies have been formed with this strategy. All these startups (not all startups btw, many have different routes to growth) are following is a well formed strategy successful companies have used. Investors have put their money for exactly the same purpose in these companies : burn and grow big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These companies will invest for a very long time to build a platform first, will come up with a large set of users and then this economy of scale helps them build many products and solutions they can monetize to invest again in growth, this is going to be a cycle till the company keeps growing fast in valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for example, Amazon was building e-commerce, then build a scalable could service to scale it up and then built AWS which they now monetize. Similarly Ola build a ride hailing service, then built a wallet to pay for that service, then will use that wallet to get into fintech and so on do forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to understand that investors have not put money into these companies for dividends on profit but growth in valuation of their equity and they are actually all growing rich by burning the money. They are doing exactly what their investors have put their money in for. This is not a sign of weakness or being unstable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are working at such a startup company where they show consistent losses and you are not sure how to differentiate between whether its a good company or not , find out information about ‚ÄúHow fast is the valuation of company growing ?‚Äù. If the valuation is growing fast and well, the company is working as expected, there is no problem !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally Answered here: https://qr.ae/TVQM9c&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;90% startups fail EVERYWHERE. There is nothing special (or worse) about India in terms of startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startups fail because of following reasons most of time :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Working on a business idea which founders cannot convince others about (investors to invest in idea/ customers to buy a product/ users to use a product).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Start scaling and spending before Product Market Fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Disagreements between founders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not being to deliver what they promise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be many many possible reasons why startups fail, everything needs to go right for a startup to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-can-a-startup-become-successful-by-outsourcing-100-of-its-employees&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúCan a startup become successful by outsourcing 100% of its employees?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/Tlev1W&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from giving out very small non-repetition tasks, I personally don‚Äôt think a startup should outsource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possible things you can outsource (with good IP agreements) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Designing websites and logo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Writing one time programming modules like say one specific task for one specific client which your product team won‚Äôt have to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Headhunting for specific profiles, organizing hackathons etc. Things that you know require lot of work for very short periods of time and then get done. Headhunting I am yet not 100% sure, in the long run, your inhouse HR team needs to build capability to find the type of people you need and essentially you are not letting that capability build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Office maintenance, accounts, lawyers etc. These things will not build company competencies if done in-house and are costlier in-house too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some content writing can be outsourced but this is a tricky one as someone from outside your company who can write an article which is good from point of view of your company is hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lead Generation might be outsourced after you have a very good idea of your customer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Anything can be outsourced early in startup by the time you are building a in-house team for the purpose, but as founders , its one‚Äôs responsibility to get the team in place as fast as possible for any task apart from ones listed in 1‚Äì6. The outsourcing companies that drop you regular mails do so because they assume you are a very young startup (or a service company where price cutting is a goal). Points 1‚Äì6 are often needed at a very early stage of a startup as well, but can extend too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you should never outsource:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Technology: Technology is your moat, if you outsource that, what competency does your team have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Digital Marketing : If you are B2B SaaS, you need to come up with your own digital media marketing strategy to beat or equal asymmetrically large opponents. If you outsource this, how would cookie cutter templates help you equal large and established brands who apply cookie cutter templates too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Product Design and Management : Same reason as 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will add to list as I come up with more ideas. HTH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-is-there-actually-a-market-for-deep-tech-startups-in-india&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúIs there actually a market for Deep Tech startups in India?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally Answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pNnZNf&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/pNnZNf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covering the whole Deep Tech scene in India in one answer would be a bit too much. Couple of chatbots startups are doing OK with Indian banks, do you count chatbots in Deep Tech ? Does acquisition by larger consumer companies count as success (People have made good money there) ? Is the startup building an India specific product or a global product with India as one of its markets?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some general points I would like to make (running a B2B AI startup &lt;a href=&quot;https://paralleldots.xyz/&quot;&gt;ParallelDots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;catering to clients in India and abroad):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don‚Äôt have enough datapoints to determine if there is a market:&lt;/strong&gt; Deep Tech startups need very good technology and a lot of R\&amp;amp;D. This increases the number of open ends to 2 in B2C (both R\&amp;amp;D and product as opposed to only product in non deep-tech startups) and 3 in B2B (R\&amp;amp;D on top of product and integration). &amp;lt;This no way means B2C is easy, its harder in fact&amp;gt;. Indians (both investors and entrepreneurs) often want the easy way out. So a lot of good engineers will want to work with Google‚Äôs of the world, entrepreneurs will try to keep lesser open ends in business and Indian investors will invest in much safer ideas. Many Indian startups are direct copies of successful products from US and China. There is much more probability of these working out. My point is there are too many low hanging fruits opposed to trying a Deep tech startup, so not a lot of people get into deep tech. Less people getting into deep tech means less ideas being tried and less visible success giving rise to (somewhat gloomy) questions like ‚ÄúIs there actually a market for Deep Tech startups in India?‚Äù . One answer is ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have enough datapoints to determine if there is a market‚Äù. This means no ecosystem, no learning material, so learning-the-hard-way for early bird deep tech startups. ‚ÄúLearning the hard way‚Äù is a slow multiple-pivot process too. So more open ends added.&lt;br /&gt;
PS: In no way I blame the Indian psych for this. Life for Indians has sparser rewards than west and they thus are risk averse. Things are getting better and we will see more Deep Tech startups here. Thinking of 11 years back when I joined engineering, there were hardly any startups at all and standard criteria for success was getting a high paying job in US. I think with more success in startup world, we will see successful people (who have had positive reinforcements from previous successes) betting on riskier ideas, some of them getting even more successful. I think the order will be marketplaces -&amp;gt; money transactions -&amp;gt; R\&amp;amp;D heavy software -&amp;gt; R\&amp;amp;D heavy hardware startups. There is a reason the one-percenters are born in an entrepreneurial society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Its hard to discover a deeptech B2C angle (not just in India):&lt;/strong&gt; There are very few Deep Tech consumer ideas from day 1 in the world. Among FAANG (Apple is a hardware company primarily) only Google was a deeptech consumer software from day 1. Adobe/Microsoft atleast initially were between B2B and B2C. Netflix, Amazon and Facebook have R\&amp;amp;D facilities to enhance their product. Same with Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. Successful consumer ideas which can create a network effect are hard to come by and one which uses Deep Tech is even harder (no wonder so few discovered yet). The existing consumer apps evolve into better versions using deep tech creating a railroad like monopoly &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/1995-96/corporate-monopolies/development_rrmon.html&quot;&gt;Development of the Railroad Monopoly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- end list --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;. DeepTech startups have been acquired by consumer businesses in AI field (in India by Flipkart, Reliance Jio and others) and that is where they will get into usage for vernacular language understanding. I dont know about any AI from day 1 consumer business doing well as of now anywhere in the world. What if Facebook comes up with a blockchain platform in near future ? It will become a monster. Trying to get so many people onboard in a new blockchain startup in India for payments, voting or referendums will be insane, for facebook, its one feature away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- end list --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In B2B, Indians pay less&lt;/strong&gt;: The same point again, our economy had almost collapsed 30 years back and we have come upto this point absolutely from nothing. Our enterprises are also becoming bigger, but we are still not like US or China say. Just like consumer startups which are gradually solving more and more high ended problems, enterprises are also only recently waking up to potential of DeepTech. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/topic/ParallelDots&quot;&gt;ParallelDots&lt;/a&gt; is a B2B business and this is a sector where we see potential in India already. We have been able to sell 30,000 - 200,000 $/year licenses in India for AI software. We have sold similar cost licenses to US companies too, but if we divide the license cost we sell by the market cap of company we sell to, US is ahead. That said, one time customer acquisition cost in India is way lower. India is also more comfortable to sell in(because its home). So both markets have tradeoffs. &lt;strong&gt;I will from my current learning say, building a B2B deeptech product only for India probably wont make sense, but building it for world and selling it in India as well seems doable.&lt;/strong&gt; We are still working out things, but we believe we are closer to make ParallelDots a success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- end list --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some other hypothesis we have from our experience in deep tech B2B as of now (please take this as a gain of salt as this is all anecdotal and we are still not exactly the most successful startup out there):&lt;br /&gt;
* Dont sell to startups&lt;br /&gt;
* Avoid other B2B companies as first clients, they might either try to acquire IP or might rather create a competitor than try you out. Just saying they shouldn‚Äôt be early customers, you can sell established products to them.&lt;br /&gt;
* Dont build a tool for technology company (esp in AI). &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/thelaunchpad/your-deep-learning-tools-for-enterprises-startup-will-fail-94fb70683834&quot;&gt;Your Deep-Learning-Tools-for-Enterprises Startup Will Fail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Make sure your investor is aligned with you and doesn‚Äôt get impatient. Also having a long runway is important.&lt;br /&gt;
* Try (tech savvy + smart) people as early adopters. They know about technology and will be willing to adopt. Just tech savvy people who are not smart will guide you with wrong/irrelevant use cases, smart but non tech-savvy people might not find your technology relevant. In India, a easy proxy is to search for engineers from IITs etc. at a good level in enterprises. Early adopters are very important. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html&quot;&gt;Startup = Growth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Stay away from (non-investing) accelerators, (free/paid but not in equity) advisors and startup schools and focus on product market fit and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if this answers the question exactly (because as I said earlier, it is a really broad question and there are not enough datapoints to come to conclusions), but it might lead to a good conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: There is of course a huge market for Deep Tech service companies in India. Most of our big software companies are actually service companies and we will have in the near future an ‚ÄúInfosys in AI‚Äù from India. I am not talking about them as I dont count them as startups. Its a different type of business with different constraints than what you have here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-what-is-the-future-of-machine-learningdeep-learning-startups&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúWhat is the future of machine learning/deep learning startups?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/TZQf4r&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally believe startups should be judged as just that : startups. The future of Machine Learning / Deep Learning startups will depend on how successful they are as a startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A startup is a business that :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Has Product Market Fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The market of the PMF (point 1) is large enough&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Has a good growth curve MoM or YoY in terms of revenue or usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Can scale the growth with application of more capital.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing different a Machine Learning/Deep Learning startup needs to do than the above 4 points. If they are successful at developing a PMF, showing good growth and raising good capital, they will work well. This was true in past, is true now and will be true in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Machine Learning/ Deep Learning in a startup increases the risks by a bit (that you have to develop these algorithms) but also functions as a moat in some way. Just building the product itself creates some barrier to entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now come the hype part. Whenever a new technology pops up, be it Deep Learning, Cryptocurrencies, blockchains etc., you will see a lot of money going into the sector. This creates a supply-demand dis-balance and the money can hence take more risk. This is what a bubble is and a lot of startups which are beyond the real metrics (that is the 4 above) get funded in this bubble. We had a bubble like this in Deep Learning startups too. So for example a startup which ‚Äúmakes a free and open source Deep Learning framework in Haskell‚Äù might even get funded in this type of an era. ‚Äúmakes a free and open source Deep Learning framework in Haskell‚Äù is an example where there is low usage (few data scientists use Haskell, which is a programming language most useful for programming language research) and is still free and open source (no monetization plan). For sure , Deep Learning startups have crossed this hype age and you can see consolidation, as mentioned in the other answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-what-are-the-key-factors-that-influence-a-startups-success-using-an-ai-technology&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúWhat are the key factors that influence a startup‚Äôs success using an AI technology?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/pNnx9y&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the following points are marker of a successful AI startup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Has it got early users ? If it is slightly mature, Has it got a Product Market Fit and has it started generating recurring revenues ? This is pretty similar to what one would expect of any B2B startup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Have they been able to setup what we at ParallelDots call ‚ÄúData Operations Pipeline‚Äù ? You need an efficient method to create initial and ongoing supervised training data for AI algorithms ? This is something really important and unless gets sorted, the tech will be lackluster. An AI startup with lackluster tech is meh. Although we might expect Data Scientists to do wonders, they are really nothing without ‚ÄúData‚Äù they can work on. A good metric to evaluate is to check how much annotated training data the startup has.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Intellectual Property and AI talent: Apart from the network effect in business and data collection, which a business can achieve only after it grows big, the only moat a young startup can create is by their intellectual property and getting good AI talent efficiently. These are things which are slightly hard to judge by non-tech people as a lot of open source and second grade talent can be marketed really well. Good metric to evaluate is publications/ open source contributions and Kaggle scores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some other things to keep in mind are:&lt;br /&gt;
A. Current day AI generally cannot predict social outcome. (So you cannot tell if someone‚Äôs going to be selected for a job interview or guessing someone‚Äôs income from their face). It cannot detect weighty subjective opinionated things like fake news (it can recognize some very pattern based instances of fake news though, like heading basically misleading as compared to article). A good rule of thumb is AI can automatically do what you can do within 3 seconds of looking at a datapoint (photo, sentence, excel row etc). &lt;a href=&quot;https://boingboing.net/2019/11/21/debullshitifying-ai.html&quot;&gt;How to recognize AI snake oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Paid developer tooling is generally a bad idea. (because all paid AI tooling is basically developer tooling). &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/thelaunchpad/your-deep-learning-tools-for-enterprises-startup-will-fail-94fb70683834&quot;&gt;Your Deep-Learning-Tools-for-Enterprises Startup Will Fail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;C. Google/Amazon/Microsoft will eventually offer AI algorithms which can be used across different companies with no change. For other companies to make dent, they have to work into something that is customized for different countries. For example if you just extract out all faces from images, the behemoths will eventually build an algorithm better than yours. However, training an algorithm to recognize company‚Äôs own employees, that is hard to build as a generic service. There are some exceptions to this point like China‚Äôs Megvii.&lt;br /&gt;
D. If you want to enter healthcare AI and it seems your product needs a government approval (like FDA say), it is a lot of work and founders need to have some expertise or hire some.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- end list --&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Basically one more point of the above is that AI startups need to have multiple expertise (Tech, AI, Business Development, Operations to collect data and client service). Its a relatively new industry and either you should be able to build a team with the expertise such diverse, and/or founders should be capable of getting out of their comfort zone to build new expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of blanket answers here like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most AI startups are farce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They don‚Äôt have Prodduct Market Fit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They don‚Äôt have resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;This is because of lack of information. There is no doubt that there is a lot of hype but there are genuine AI first companies in India. If you don‚Äôt know about it, please don‚Äôt bundle them with the pretentious people you so hate. Hype startups is not a unique phenomenon to India and is very common in Silicon Valley. When a lot of probability of success is dependence upon ‚Äúimpressing‚Äù VCs to raise money, you cannot always blame entrepreneurs. [Much of what‚Äôs being sold as ‚ÄòAI‚Äô today is snake oil, says Princeton professor&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Computing](https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3084079/ai-snake-oil)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also a lot of problems in the real world can be solved with simpler technology and you really don‚Äôt need AI in everything. Making a startup a success is a hard thing (like really hard). Now you add to it the complexities that come with a AI startup (getting money to buy resources to support the technology and getting a team which can solve the problem statement and startups are expected to grow like crazy while AI research you do is kind of slow), you are basically talking about a way harder to succeed startup. Basically if your odds of succeeding in a startup is 1:100 , succeeding in a AI startup is say 1:500. So the ratio of successful people to pretentious people in AI startup communities is skewed towards the latter (given pretentious people are roughly in the same probability in every sector). I dont blame you too much for generalization, the world does look like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, startups who have a different product and are selling a small AI feature will boast about it a lot because they have invested in it to create a differentiator, but they are neither AI startups, nor you should judge AI first startups according to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I would like to say is that there are startups there which have achieved Product Market Fit of a AI first product , have original technology and research and have raised enough money to have a research team and infrastructure to build technology. We will see some of them become success stories in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally Answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pNnZGd&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/pNnZGd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait.. what ? In no economics book/report will you see such a thing happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general fear from a ‚ÄúTechnology Startup‚Äù ruining or distorting a traditional business is just &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chinese_Stories/The_frog_of_the_well&quot;&gt;Chinese Stories/The frog of the well&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;type situation. (I hope that is the hypothesis on which this question was asked, I cannot think of another reason why this question will be framed). The world is becoming more centralized, connected and institutionalized. Technology Startups are essentially doing the same thing in India. With the new technology tools available (specifically internet and smartphones), they are making the economy more lean, efficient and competitive and addressing a way larger market making things accessible for consumers using network effect. This might come as a surprise(hence this type of questions) to people only aware of old school businesses who are accustomed to more easier times of smaller markets. India cannot get stuck in the rut of status quo of old days and wait for a rude shock, we have to move with the world, maybe even faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand more, there are two types of businesses: arbitrage based (an example is taxi hailing services, retail distributor, or a house broker or any such middleman) and Products and Services (a car producing company, a hairdresser, moviemaker etc). A subset of both types of businesses (and specially middleman businesses) exist just because there is an inefficiency in the market. A lot of inefficient Product and Services businesses went out of existence as middlemen slowly connected people to good product/service providers and the bad ones simply vanished. Think of it, a bakery in your area was slowly replaced by cheaper and better product of a bakery which became the most known bakery in the town and then state and country level bakeries slowly formed. So ‚ÄúMiddlemen‚Äù businesses in fact emerged to solve inefficient ‚ÄúProduct and Services‚Äù businesses. Most of small businesses in India slowly migrated to Middlemen businesses from product and services businesses. So a television store in your town just does that, buys TV at INR X and sells it at INR (X + Profit). Middleman instead of trying to produce a television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with Internet and Technology, these middlemen are now being optimized one level more. Many layers of inefficient middlemen can now be replaced by a larger company. That is what is happening when Tech startups come up. Its basically the next and modern version of your local singer losing business to Arijeet Singh because ways to transfer good songs over long distance with popularity of audio cassette in 1980s. Ola is replacing your Taxi services, Oyo your typical hotel guy on railway station, Flipkart is replacing your electronic stores and Grofers your grocer shop. They do it at a scale way larger and way more efficient. To win trust, they use cashbacks and discounts instead of their local reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-what-initiatives-should-india-take-to-be-an-ai-superpower&quot;&gt;My Answer to ‚ÄúWhat initiatives should India take to be an AI superpower?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Original Answer Here: https://qr.ae/TeyruI&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some advantages in India :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lot of young people. Even if 1% of software engineers in india can be good at AI, we have the largest AI workforce of the world. Similarly, too many entrepreneurs as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lot of people interested in working in STEM and esp AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Jugaad, art of getting things done with some quirk and meager resources is common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some disadvantages of India:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Youth not attached to country, often aim of many is to settle outside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;1 can still be offsetted by our large population, but then, there is too much of a ‚Äúparticipation/entitlement culture‚Äù . &lt;strong&gt;Because we are Indian citizens, we should have easy education&lt;/strong&gt; (we should have easy access to education, not easy education itself. Most Indian education system is ‚Äúnavigable‚Äù, its hard, but we all know there is a way to somehow get through it without putting the work required. Last years‚Äô papers, teacher coachings, getting class notes and other shortcuts. Most students, even the ones who top, will understand what I am saying, they all know there is a way where they could have studied better.). &lt;strong&gt;When we get easy education, we want easy jobs.&lt;/strong&gt; Easy jobs are serfdom, modern serfdom is not as hard as earlier and lot of people want to get stuck there and enjoy life. No ‚Äúsuperpower‚Äù can come out of serfdom, AI superpower, defence superpower whatever. &lt;strong&gt;Discouraging risk taking has to go from our culture. Fear of failing makes our education, jobs, research institutes , universities, companies look for easy hacks out.&lt;/strong&gt; ‚ÄúJugaad‚Äù (at which Indians are really smart) is a very very good thing if it achieves an objective different from doing-less-work, unfortunately, Indians tend to use Jugaad for this a lot. You all know about the student who scores really well while there is someone else better at the subject, or a famous software engineer who seldom codes and mostly writes Medium blogs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Innovators coming out of our engineering education/jobs/research institutes is exception, not norm, because people figure out shortcuts. You cannot innovate if you are not well educated/avoid hardwork about a topic.&lt;br /&gt;
Net-Net, easy-way-out thing needs to go from our culture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Average Indian is very very ignorant about what is going on in the world. Maybe so is the rest of world too, but hence the rest of world is not a superpower. &lt;strong&gt;To be a superpower, India needs to make information reach the last person.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a set of upcoming skill sets: green energy, AI, blockchain, Genetic Engineering and other things which will change the future. Also called forth industrial revolution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/&quot;&gt;The Fourth Industrial Revolution: what it means and how to respond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, we need to grow skills towards these new industries if we need to be a superpower. Indian students who will enter the labour market soon are wrongly advised and often end up studying for subjects which have literally very few opportunities in India. As a result , we have millions and millions of students who study for years in courses which they will not need. Think about how many millions of years we have wasted. So for handful of Civil Engineering jobs, where in India, one can just get in by a Polytechnic education ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuing_education&quot;&gt;Continuing education - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;), we have students in almost all Engineering Colleges doing Civil Engineering majors. Why so ? A lot of them join jobs unrelated to their degree. We essentially convert degree workforce into secondary educated workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes looking at points above, we need the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve the information asymmetry.&lt;/strong&gt; Tell people what is the next big thing. Eventually people will understand, but we need to convert all the millions of years (mentioned earlier) we are wasting into good resources. This efficiency in economy will help us getting ahead fast. Government actually gets many surveys done, but it needs to let the information reach the masses the languages they can understand. Maybe something like a ‚ÄúMann Ki Baat‚Äù for education and industry or Modi dedicating a few of these episodes to such topics ? (I will actually try suggesting this on their online suggestions portal).&lt;br /&gt;
Indians pay for Education. The recent wave of eductech startups might also solve this really well, but a more sober and serious voice than a young entrepreneur needs to convince the people that doing stupid majors is not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make failing while trying to learn and do acceptable.&lt;/strong&gt; We have designed our incentives wrong way. Most of our people will find a person completing a PHD in 5 years with better publications worse than someone completing their PHD in 4 years with worse publications. We can &lt;strong&gt;maybe have research/entreprenurship courses in all degrees where we give marks for amount of hardwork done and not results.&lt;/strong&gt; It sounds easy, but Indians are master at avoiding hardwork as I told earlier, so needs to be done cleverly. In fact in a world where research is becoming very important (most industrial revolution 4 technologies need a graduate + level education) , we don‚Äôt have &lt;strong&gt;enough top tier people doing research&lt;/strong&gt; and its generally considered a career for those who want to do a ‚Äúteaching‚Äù (not academic) job. This is a cultural thing and needs a collective resolve to move ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government needs to stop giving useless scholarships in irrelevant subjects and direct this money into new sectors.&lt;/strong&gt; I heard recently that there is scholarship for studying (even research in these languages might not help the nation, but this scholarship is for doing a Bachelor degree, you need to pay like 3 cents a month as residential fees) Pashto and Persian in JNU. I don‚Äôt think that there is anyway this will help the country. We need to &lt;strong&gt;divert the money into STEM research, specifically AI.&lt;/strong&gt; Good resources flowing into AI research will definitely change the picture a lot. Think of economically weak students studying Computer Engineering on similar scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force people out of their comfort zone:&lt;/strong&gt; This is not easy, but unless people are made to get out of their comfort zones, we wont get the efficiency required to become a post Industrial Revolution 4 superpower. Professors who are doing ineffective research need to be transitioned into a role where they can solve useful problems, companies need to attack more open-ended business problems to solve with AI and government needs to redirect investment from useless research and departments and PSUs to things that will yield good results in future. We need to make sure &lt;strong&gt;people are ready to get reeducated and reassigned and we need to then quickly change face of our economy.&lt;/strong&gt; This involves lot of uncertainties and people will need to adapt. As expected, it will be a hard pill to swallow, but better adapt before someone forces to adapt. Like point 2 this needs a collective resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So , sum total, we need to develop a collective resolve to change the current situation. getting ahead in any field (including AI) needs resolve to change. Comfortable life if not something that will make you move ahead at a pace you can defeat others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5G&lt;/strong&gt; is a lost cause, we have no companies that work in 5G technologies and all our telecom companies will be doing is paying huge sums of money to Chinese companies like Huawei to install these new cellphone networks.

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/pN2Ivf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to learn the difference between different ways a foreign country can get involved in our economy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investments without controlling stake (investment) :&lt;/strong&gt; Basically meaning that an external country wants to share the risk for growing our economy by investing in return for future gains if our economy grows. Also they dont have controlling stake in return of this, so no say in management, but share in profits. This is basically the best way to finance the growth of the country, it has nothing that can go wrong, all risk goes to investor, thus you really need to make the country as an attractive investment destination to get such funds. This investment is in the form of shares in startups, companies, businesses, utilities which will profit as economy grows. Most startups fall in this category (or very very rarely in 2 if they screw up badly or exit to a foreign company).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment with a controlling stake (investment) :&lt;/strong&gt; When your economy doesn‚Äôt have as good a reputation or if your economy doesnt grow as planned after getting investments like 1, you still need money, so companies, utilities etc have to dilute more giving controlling stake to foreign investors. The investors still take all the risk, but they also now make management decisions. Big companies like Maruti-Suzuki or Flipkart are examples of this. Also examples of this are subsidiaries of foreign companies like say Samsung India or Ford motors India.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying government bonds (investment) :&lt;/strong&gt; If the economy has no or bad reputation, no one wants to take the risk and hence government has to take money to fund its economy as loan. That is government is taking debt on behalf of its citizens to grow its economy and pay debt using the economic growth. Citizens take all the risk in such a scenario. More often than not government mismanages the money (governments are good at doing so) and things turn out to be worse. Examples are bankrupt Venezuela and Argentina. Only very disciplined countries like post world war Germany and Japan and Singapore have been able to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launching competitive products (exports) :&lt;/strong&gt; When foreign companies launch products which are competitive to local products, that is similar cost and competition based on utility and quality. This is good for local products, foreign products and customers all three. That is how it is supposed to work in case of a symmetrical trade agreement (Generally such agreements are not what happens with weak governments, places in Africa have to throw away their own vegetable products and buy costly foreign vegetables due to agreements) . India has very good competition in some segment of its economy like automobiles, airlines, software and ecommerce etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Dumping (exports) :&lt;/strong&gt; This is when foreign companies can sell cheap products in a country without any competition from local products. This is very very good for consumers as they get the cheapest products in the short term. However, this slowly erodes out local competition. For example, In India, we have no high-tech defence industry, electronics, cellphones, computers, scientific instruments etc. due to dominance of cheap product dumping of foreign companies. While it is good to have some give and take and have local monopoly in some segments and foreign monopoly in others, that is what ‚Äúspecialization‚Äù means, but country becomes totally dependent on others due to Product Dumping. You should remember that British actually colonized us to dump products apart from agriculture, without any competition from others and we were left really poor and bad at the time of independence because we were just consuming and producing nothing. In its retaliation, we just stopped all exports (another extreme like colonization ) for next 50 years creating a bad socialist economy. ‚ÄúAll or nothing‚Äù makes no sense, we need to be practical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importing Skills which are lacking (immigration) :&lt;/strong&gt; Get high skilled people who complement skill of local populace. We are really bad at this, as lot of smart people emigrate. This is probably because we have developed a culture of staying away from risk. Smart people can do good in our country too, but the path is harder. Other countries easily attract our top talent showing them easy life (which is not as easy in long term in many cases).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replacing local workers with cheaper resources (immigration):&lt;/strong&gt; A country can also supply cheap labour to our economy. Indians emigrate outside for jobs for which Bangladeshis emigrate to India. Its a same of wages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of this is beneficial economically ? Actually all of these are economically beneficial to someone or the other in country. While local companies love 1,4 and 7, consumers love 3,5 and 7. (They love 3 as they get short term cheap money to enjoy which they often repent investing in depreciating interests). Nothing is really good or bad economically as long is peaceful trade goes on, or as Adam Smith says, the invisible hand . However, if disputes and probles arise, a more antifragile country is the one which has more self sufficiency as compared to dependency on export. A more antifragile country will become more powerful postpartum..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CoronaVirus pandemic for example will effect Germany and China less than UK or Afghanistan which are more dependent on trade and exports. So, 1,4 and 6 actually make the economy more antifragile according to me. Stopping investments like 1 (that is startups), push us towards 3 or debts, which actually are worse, you cannot grow the economy without money/funding. 1 is the most convex way to fund it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most startups, unless have been acquired by a foreign country are totally run by the founders. As long as founders run the companies based in India and from India, they are going to make the nation more powerful at critical switch events of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop thinking that you can grow the economy without money, growth needs money. Indians often understate this. The most convex way to fund the growth of economy is 1, that is Investments without controlling stake, which most startups fall into. You give some advantage to China if you allow them to invest, but the alternative is worse (taking debt say or not growing economy is much more antifragile). &lt;em&gt;Basically, the right way is to help more new local companies grow with (maybe more foreign) investments so that we become more and more self dependent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL,DR : When you want to stop foreign firms investing in Indian startups, you are actually wanting to make the country more antifragile, trust me your intention is right but method is wrong. Unless startups are getting acquired by foreign firms and are becoming Indian or India based companies, the best way is to let them grow by foreign investment. What Indians need to do is create a culture of buying local products and creating a culture where people dont do time renting instead of entrepreneurship and people/companies want to stay in India rather than wanting to run abroad. This would be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-can-the-edtech-companies-sustain-their-growth-after-the-schools-are-opened-in-india&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúCan the EdTech companies sustain their growth after the schools are opened in India?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here : &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pNCy0V&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/pNCy0V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess is Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think that the reason is that Edtech platforms create a more efficient market overcoming inefficiencies of distance, cost and access to good teachers. In an efficient market, customers get more value for their money, that is paying the same amount of money, they can get better quality of education. For example, a very good teacher in Dehradun might have not been able to teach any students from Lucknow, which is a much more populous city, despite them being excellent at their work. An efficient marketplace of skills basically allows efficient/high-quality vendors to disrupt the market because of ridiculous reduction in cost of expansion. Basically, even if someone was really good at teaching, they would have had to do marketing, advertising and remote teaching investments apart from word of mouth to grow their business beyond a certain level and disrupt business of other not-as-good teachers earlier, which was really rare and hard. Now all they need is a account on one of the edtech platforms and likes and shares of their students. I dont think the market will return to the old normal in EdTech now. This is very similar to TikTok, but in an industry where people are willing to pay themselves rather than watch ads, that is the reason why EdTech is so powerful. Solid example of Creative Destruction : &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction&quot;&gt;Creative destruction - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem earlier was that status-quo was a bit too strong and people were not adopting EdTech as rapidly due to inertia. There were many phases of EdTech startups founding and funding in India before 2020, but they found it really hard to break the status quo. COVID disruption acted as the singularity which broke the inertia and made people embrace EdTech, I dont think this is a reversible change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/pNk14e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 things I consider very important to be a successful entrepreneur :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Intelligence :&lt;/strong&gt; ‚ÄúAll smart people don‚Äôt goto IITs/NITs‚Äù and ‚ÄúNot every IIT/NIT student is smart‚Äù, but you will agree that many of them have above average intelligence. Certain amount of intelligence is needed to be an entrepreneur and many good colleges will have kids like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awareness/Environment/Compounding :&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most important, but really underrated property. Good colleges are a gathering of high percentage smart people who are connected to other smart people and know about what is going on in the world. The environment and conditioning in 4 years can change people‚Äôs world views a lot and make them look at world in a way that helps them churn out successful technology businesses. This is not unique to IITs say, Stanford, Cambridge &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts&quot;&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- end list --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;and OxBridge etc have demonstrated this too. You can also see this in other spheres of life as many successful businessmen come out of successful business families and many brave army officers come out of army families and many civil servants come from civil servant families. Environment and conditioning compound over time and give a distinct advantage. I think this is the major contributions top colleges bring to ones life, awareness and network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- end list --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Appetite :&lt;/strong&gt; Any successful entrepreneur is one who takes many risks. Risks which have extremely high payouts (in Billions of dollars) and relatively less loss (say 2 year in career growth). When one takes 10 such risks, they have probability of getting success is OK, when one takes 1 such risk, their probability of success is close to zero. Although it might sound unfair, but it is about trying to get lucky while losing out less for every trial. IITians and people from top college know that the payout on success is huge, while on failing their degree/credential will give them some kind of a social security by getting them a decent job. For someone without a credential, its just way harder making their risk appetite less. Introduce some kind of achievement based social security for entrepreneurs and see the number of startups from non-elite colleges soar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cannot say about dropouts, you don‚Äôt have too many dropouts in India ! Peter Thiel asks people to dropout and work on their business and when you look at his fellows, that doesn‚Äôt look entirely wrong. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship&quot;&gt;Thiel Fellowship - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, society in India recognizes credentials much more (probably because we were rules by British in past) and the factor 2 above will not be fully possible for a dropout. That said, one can build awareness and network without going to a top college too, its not impossible, they just need to know what to do and stay committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-answer-to-should-india-build-its-own-app-store-under-the-atmanirbhar-bharat-campaign&quot;&gt;My answer to ‚ÄúShould India build its own app store under the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally Answered Here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pN4yVA&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/pN4yVA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. This issue has come up as App Store blocked PayTM and many other Indian apps. I am in favor of an alternative Indian app store, but not in the way most people are suggesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential reasons I see :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An app store like Google or Apple‚Äôs aim is to better the company‚Äôs profits and perception. They might be doing good to India as a side effect, but in anyway if their interests are orthogonal or opposite to the nation, they will follow their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A lot of gatekeeping can happen to stop Indian innovation as rich apps will pay better. While its good if an app gets less views and thus downloads due to bad quality, but its easy to drown out apps with less marketing budget just by pouring lot of money. Even if you want to discover new apps which dont pay as much for marketing, its hard. Indian apps thus need to raise load of money to just get noticed, that‚Äôs hard in a low income country when compared to a rich country like US and China. Its correct for app stores to show apps from which they get advertising revenue, but to make sure that discovering apps without marketing is hard looks monopolistic behavior to me. Competition is very important in capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;BTW, if you think this is some kind of communist, alt-right idea or nationalist idea, please look at the ongoing feuds Apple‚Äôs App Store is involved in :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments&quot;&gt;Apple just kicked Fortnite off the App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://exactscan.com/MAS/&quot;&gt;Mac App Store updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-epic-and-the-app-store/&quot;&gt;Apple, Epic, and the App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/05/how-apple-uses-its-app-store-copy-best-ideas/&quot;&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/05/how-apple-uses-its-app-store-copy-best-ideas/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Too many viewpoints suggesting the same thing. The problem is the that you have the same institution as arbitrator, enforcer and profit maker. Its too much power in one place. Its effective in short term(like it was till now) ,but in long run they cannot help but look towards profits in case of a conflict. That‚Äôs not what needs to be done if we want competition and quality to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there will be no point if we build another common platform as a monopoly or oligarchy in India. You would end up making another app store / play store and the same issues will come up in sometime. No single company / group of companies should be both arbitrator and enforcer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its time for a decentralized app store, probably run/managed by blockchain/smart-contracts !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pN4NYf&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/pN4NYf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They cannot in an ideal free market, unless some very fundamental changes occur in search and social networking in India (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creativedestruction.asp&quot;&gt;Understanding Creative Destruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Destruction happens).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reason is simple, Facebook and Google are rich and their product will always be higher quality and provide better utility at lower cost/effort. Its a very well known phenomenon mentioned even in Bible: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_talents_or_minas&quot;&gt;Parable of the talents or minas - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. The person with more money/resources does better. Facebook has Network Effect, an even more powerful phenomenon as its moat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can happen is some fundamental process, a new technology or changes in ways people use search/social media or a realignment of society or something else which gives Indian startups an edge, and they can win. Say China, where government banned these websites, enabling local products. But if nothing changes, it is going to be impossible to replace Google and Facebook just due to their sheer magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

But the same people want their friend or child to be in a big company or a good government job. Why?‚Äù&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pNFJeq&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/pNFJeq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very subjective answer here, you are welcome to disagree :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I come to such a question, I see people complaining about government, culture and education quality. Most of them do not understand that this ‚Äúcomplaining‚Äù is the reason why India doesn‚Äôt have enough entrepreneurs. If most people on looking at a problem, start bickering and think some higher power (authority, government, God) should solve it, it tells that they are not willing to take any initiative in their hands to change things. Successful entrepreneurs, leaders and heroes are the type of people who cause changes, they cannot come from among people who expect others to solve stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One water logging in Delhi and the entire nation starts complaining about the inefficient machinery, maybe try and not throw solid waste into drains built to remove liquid waste when its not raining as a people‚Äô movement. For most Indians, one month salary doesnt come into account and everyone from spouse to parents will start complaining to a person, leaving almost no room open to take risks. Half of our people cannot even think about starting a business because ‚ÄúWhat about ABC ?‚Äù thoughts will take over. Not saying everyone is in a condition and a risk appetite to get into entrepreneurship, but even the ones can do it, dont dare to do it. Even if there is a leader or entrepreneur who takes risk, others will rush to complain and tell about how ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù/‚Äùdangerous‚Äù step it is. We are addicted to the comfort preplanned stability provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It isn‚Äôt like this is a part of our traditions, our heroes(and antiheros and villains) from Ramayana , Mahabharata and the like, did not complain, they took life the way it is and did what is required to make it better. Lord Ram could have stayed back in one secluded part of the forest rather than going and punishing demons which caught the attention of Surpnakha and then Ravana leading to hard times for him, or worse, just used some technicality to stay back in Ayodhya itself. But he achieved his greatness because he did not crib, he acted. Gita emphasizes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_yoga#Bhagavad_Gita&quot;&gt;Karma yoga - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;, which basically is doing the right thing and not complaining. Unfortunately, I think the attitude of people shifted from doing the right thing to debating what is the right thing to do somewhere in History. This discussion of ‚Äúwhat is right‚Äù becomes important as the world gets more grey than black or white as it evolves, but this also gives a comfort zone for inaction. Just keep complaining and do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is a phase of civilization when people decide they are content and dont want to really do the hard solving part all the time and enjoy their lives. India must have switched to this mode when we became an agricultural powerhouse and export center between 0‚Äì1000 AD I guess. Post colonial Europe became like that too with the welfare state. You will see very few startups coming out of Europe. The current political upheaval in America seems to starting the phase transition there as well from crude ‚Äúevery man for himself‚Äù to progressive ‚Äúgovernment takes care of us all and gives us stable/peaceful lives‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Good Read : &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/&quot;&gt;IT‚ÄôS TIME TO BUILD - Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL,DR : Indians clearly prefer a stable life, successful entrepreneurs‚Äô (or leaders‚Äô or heroes‚Äô) life is filled with upheavals. Look at how a Greek Tragedy shows a hero‚Äôs life :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-04-14-Views-on-Indian-Startups/media/image4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plot Lord Ram‚Äôs life it would look like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-04-14-Views-on-Indian-Startups/media/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs not what risk averse people want their lives to look like. Not saying you should pick all bets and risks, that is stupid, but people need to recognize convex risks and take them to get ahead. However, they do like the stories of heroes. If a movie comes out on life of Elon Musk, it will be a crazy gazzillion dollar movie. Humans love &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis&quot;&gt;Catharsis - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. They thus want more entrepreneurs around. I mean who cannot love this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will collect some of my answers here regarding fresher Machine Learrning jobs in India as I have some experience in this domain and hire in this domain quite often&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-what-should-i-do-to-get-a-job-in-machine-learning-in-india-&quot;&gt;Q. What should I do to get a job in Machine Learning in India ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a simple rule, work on an interesting project, get some results and put on display (Google, kaggle etc). Most employers can gauge your interest when they look at your profile. An entry level Machine Learning Engineer who can explain the Maths behind the algorithms they apply in some non-trivial problem is good enough for a lot of companies, they are not expecting seasoned veterans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following types of projects look very impressive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Taking a research/kaggle competition and working on its dataset. The code to handle such problems is a good proof of ones capability. The other good way is contributions to open source ML. The more you know what works behind your solution, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Taking a paper (or taking a set of papers by a research group) and trying to code the algorithm/replicate the results is even better than 1 (at least for us at ParallelDots).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An academic/industrial publication is even better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is what is not enough:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Forking code for Bicycle challenge or other such competitions (the Titanic one as well) and running it and submitting that as previous work. They are too many tutorials for them and people won‚Äôt take you seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Completing Andrew Ng course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unless you are applying in a very big enterprise, I will say avoid certification and try working on personal projects. That is way more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Again, Please don‚Äôt just fork code on Github and expect employers to believe you have worked. Its easy to see how much you have worked. :(&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-is-it-not-possible-for-a-fresher-to-work-as-a-machine-learning-engineer-&quot;&gt;Q. Is it not possible for a fresher to work as a Machine Learning Engineer ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not ‚Äúnot possible‚Äù for a fresher to join as machine learning engineer if he she is very good at it. Wrong conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen freshers taking role of machine learning engineer at enterprises and even my startup. The problem is ‚Äúhe she is very good at it‚Äù part . Freshers often (not always, I know freshers with CVs as good as a professional ML engineer) over estimate their CVs as they don‚Äôt know about how real world works , they have very high expectations due to that and real world is unable to meet that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-what-is-the-learning-path-after-going-through-basic-machine-leaning-material-&quot;&gt;Q. What is the learning path after going through basic Machine Leaning material ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Does one do projects, go for a summer training in Hadoop in Delhi, read books ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Please see link to blog posts below to find all these books)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMHO, projects are the best way to learn (as you said you want to become a factory data scientist and are not in a mood to pursue a higher degree ). Taking different datasets for different types of problems and trying to come up with a data processing pipeline and then applying Machine Learning algorithms on top of it helped to clear many concepts for me. Its way more fun than all theory. Look at UCI or Kaggle datasets to apply your skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. From where should I do summer training in big data hadoop(Delhi)? (or in any other specific technology)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dont. Hadoop is just a framework to write programs. If from starting years of your career, you start concentrating on technologies (hadoop / mysql / postgre / java / python / scala and stuff like that), you will end up becoming a &amp;lt;specific technology&amp;gt; professional (say hadoop professional). Technology trends come and go, unless the fundamentals (which here is distributed computing) behind them is clear, one would never be able to adapt to the changing market . As long as you know programming basics well, stuff like Hadoop would be easy to pick up when your job requires it. You can try triggering a mapreduce job on your local system with help of an online tutorial, that is a different thing, but taking a full on course on hadoop is neither required nor recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some other points I would like to specify as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) Hadoop is for handling very large amount of data (Terabyte+), which most places do not have. Unlike what the internet hype (and plethora of hadoop training institutes in India want you to believe), most companies still have small data which can fit easily on a postgres cluster if not one server. Data Analysis skill is required almost everywhere, Hadoop at best in few 100 offices in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) Apart from HDFS, most parts of hadoop ecosystem are already being replaced/renovated by the innovation leader companies. Google (the inventor) phased out mapreduce &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/the-elephant-was-a-trojan-horse-on-the-death-of-map-reduce-at-google/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;The Elephant was a Trojan Horse: On the Death of Map-Reduce at Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, projects like mahout already seem to be moving away from hadoop and a lot of companies seem to be moving towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ - Lightning-Fast Cluster Computing&lt;/a&gt; . Now by the time you become professional, spark might be the talk of the town, in 10 more years even it might be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would rather advice you to read books like mmds, foundations of data science, ISLR, Deep Learning etc. All of them are freely available on internet. Save your money and time (reading them now than you would read them after you graduate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit : Adding the link to books (will rather link the blog post at ParallelDots we made collecting links to all these books, most of them freely available)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-do-companies-hire-data-scientists-with-zero-internship-experience&quot;&gt;Q. Do companies hire data scientists with zero internship experience?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Doing an internship is not necessary to work in Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most companies won‚Äôt hire Data Scientists with no experience of solving real world problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say anything out the following gives you equal (or more) weightage than internship at a tech startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A bronze medal or better at Kaggle,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A research project under an academic that resulted in a publication at a decent venue,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An internship doing a proper AI project (which is to be deployed within the company), (whose alternatives we are discussing),&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Contribution to an open source project,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some other way in which you have worked in a real world setting optimizing for different constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger companies working in Data Science, maybe like Fractal and Manthan, might be hiring absolute freshers too, but most companies in this space are small startups who cannot take risk if hiring absolute freshers and training them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-is-it-true-that-maths-or-statistics-isnt-required-at-all-in-data-science-while-programming-skills-are-required-my-friend-told-me-the-same-thing-he-said-thats-why-a-majority-of-data-scientists-are-from-btech-backgrounds-not-from-maths-or-stats&quot;&gt;Q. Is it true that maths or statistics isn‚Äôt required at all in data science while programming skills are required? My friend told me the same thing. He said that‚Äôs why a majority of data scientists are from BTech backgrounds, not from maths or stats.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any respectable Engineering program (BTech) has a sizable number of Maths and Statistics courses. At BITS Pilani, I had coursework in Vector Calculus, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Optimization and Operations Research (each one was a separate 1 semester long course) which every Engineering student had to take. On top of this there were Computer Science specific subjects (Data Mining, Machine Learning) which taught the Maths and Programming part both to everyone. The theory taught in these many courses is frankly enough to read most Data Science papers and understand concepts (You might need to read a couple of tutorials here and there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the hypothesis that Engineering students aren‚Äôt aware of Maths and Stats is a wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now about Data Scientists not needing Maths skill, data scientist as a job description is very broad just like software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can say that Software Engineer doesn‚Äôt need to know about Databases, and that will be true for many people: Software Engineers who write Operating Systems, Software Engineers who develop frontend applications, Software Engineers who write compilers and below par Software Engineers who work on web application backends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are similarly many job descriptions for Data Scientists. Some of them actually don‚Äôt require too much Maths and just programming, but most of them do require some basics of the above mentioned mathematical areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally Answered here: https://qr.ae/TiNJou&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some mistakes according to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Focusing too much on math in the initial stages. To train your first Neural networks, you don‚Äôt need to know in detail how backprop works (backprop derivatives of all ops for example), or you don‚Äôt need to understand the support vector derivation to train SVMs. Dont start reading complicated mathematical resources in the beginning, it makes learning very slow. Touch on these topics when you are somewhat experienced writing code and training algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Focusing too little on Math is similarly bad too. Not knowing what different parameters to a Conv layer in Keras signify is also sub optimal. A basic book on Machine Learning with theory is best starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Practising less. This is what differentiates between good and excellent practitioners. Most excellent practitioners can think of 100s of ideas around a dataset and can iterate quickly on them. That is how accuracy on a dataset will go up. Other practitioners will waste time in thinking about what would be the perfect method and code their ‚Äúone best‚Äù method in hours, which will mostly not work in the end. You cannot think in advance what should be the method for best accuracy, EDA and trail-and-error is the key. Remember during practicing ‚ÄúGetting average accuracy on multiple datasets &amp;lt;&amp;lt; multiple round of iteration to get good accuracy on one dataset‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not focusing on basics numpy and pandas. As I said earlier, you need to iterate over many ideas quickly rather than thinking of ‚Äúone true idea‚Äù that will work. Its grit boring work. To make this quicker, good command on Numpy and Pandas help. Lesser number of Google searhes == more code. Tensorflow/PyTorch have been purposefully written close to Numpy to make sure that Numpy users can iterate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Original Answer Here: https://qr.ae/pNncvm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view most inexperienced Machine Learning people (including me say 6‚Äì7 years back) focus more on algorithm than data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newbies want to try out all the 250 (dummy number) algorithms on the dataset they have got without EDA on the data itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the algorithm will generally give what 2‚Äì3% (again dummy number for giving an idea about magnitude) gains in accuracy, while, arranging/ balancing/ feature engineering/ augmenting the data can give manifold accuracy gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning is not yet a cool art where you summon a Charlizard and then it will be burn the competitor to the ground. It requires grit, getting dirty with the data and understanding what is the algorithm learning through many boring iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

I just hired an unqualified machine learning engineer, he know only some basic Tensorflow and have no idea about the maths and build more complex neural networks, should I fire him immediately or give him 2 months to improve?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did you hire an ‚Äúunqualified‚Äù person ? Don‚Äôt you have a job description and interview process ? If there is such a huge gap between the hiring and requirement, I think its a problem with the company leadership and process. You should understand who you want to hire for what exact profile before you even put the JD out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you should do next is dependent on what is expected of the employee in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you expect him to do something Math(y) ? I don‚Äôt think they will be able to learn in 2 months. OTOH, 99.9% of the companies won‚Äôt need people who can write ‚Äúnew and complex‚Äù neural networks. Its mostly about transforming the data well, using clever training methods and loss functions etc. That said, even to gain enough experience for this, they will need more than 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general observation I have is that a lot of companies don‚Äôt have clear specs and requirements and they expect their Data Scientists to weave magic. Then they won‚Äôt hire senior people who can tell what is possible and what is not and put the entire pressure of expectations on cheap ‚Äúfresher‚Äù employees, who generally have no real world experience (and many times will overestimate their capabilities, thus signing into something they cannot accomplish). This type of org structure is a house of cards. Hope this is not the case with your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the work is running different open source models and experiments, 2 months is a decent time to learn and apply. If your expectation is in a domain , which is well worked and researched in, 2 months should be a good time for a less experienced person to catch up. If the expected work is this much, the hiring strategy is also not wrong and this is the general capability of talent available in the market. Groom them a bit for 2 months and everything should work out. If the expectation is any more open ended, you have made a wrong hiring decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of AI talent as of 2019 end. Too many people in India know basics about AI and can be trained to work. I am not sure if there is a way to see people applying for AI positions but if there was a way, you could clearly see that way many people apply for all AI/Data Science job (at least here in India). There was a time when just knowing some basics got you a job but no more now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem has now shifted to retaining top talent as too many people in the world are applying AI and working abroad is a big deal for most Indians. &lt;em&gt;So the situation is a lot more like Software Development profiles now for most AI profiles too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge pool of talent and there is arms race for retaining top talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post is also an answer by me on Quora &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Will-data-science-and-machine-learning-get-automated-leading-to-lesser-opportunities-for-data-scientists-as-per-https-www-datasciencecentral-com-profiles-blogs-data-scientists-automated-and-unemployed-by-2025-update/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes. (2025 is not the date I think its going to happen, but its inevitable and will happen in near future). They will be automated to a good extent. So will be Software Developers, designers, manual workers, teachers, linguists, musicians, game developers etc,etc. There are already rudimentary projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.floydhub.com/turning-design-mockups-into-code-with-deep-learning/&quot;&gt;Turning Design Mockups Into Code With Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt; which can turn a design mockup into HTML/CSS code, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carpedm20/ENAS-pytorch&quot;&gt;carpedm20/ENAS-pytorch&lt;/a&gt; which can design neural networks without a Data Scientist, &lt;a href=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why AutoML Is Set To Become The Future Of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; , system which can generate new characters for games, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.business-standard.com/article/international/microsoft-ai-can-translate-chinese-to-english-just-as-accurately-as-humans-118031500414_1.html&quot;&gt;Microsoft AI can translate Chinese to English just as accurately as humans&lt;/a&gt; , [Baidu‚Äôs Deep Voice can clone speech with less than four seconds of training&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI will impact every job profile which exists as of now, Data Scientists no exception, automating some or a lot of work people spend their time on. For a lot of time these systems will become a &amp;lt;Man + Machine&amp;gt; AI systems rather than just a Human working before stuff is totally automated. So its not like everyone becomes redundant day 1, but they will eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full Automation of any field is going to take way longer than 2025 IMHO. That said, yes a lot less people will be needed for the same task as of today. Then what will people do you ask ? newer more complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation is not a new phenomenon. Think about the railway breaks a long time back:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://muktabh.xyz/assets/img/2020-03-20-Views-on-Fresher-Data-Science-Jobs/media/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video Link Here: https://youtu.be/EEUkmP2nyxo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much work was once needed to just stop the train. A lot lesser work is needed today to run/stop the train and not just that, slowly trains are moving towards full automation, but right now they are in a &amp;lt;man + machine&amp;gt; stage. A lot of jobs will stay in this phase for sometime before full automation kicks in. But unlike railways, which take generations to move from one stage of automation to another, AI is causing changes at a very high rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the effect on a general Data Scientist (or any white/blue collared worker for that matter):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Adapt to AI. Automation has started, but AI aided jobs will stay for a few more years than non-AI jobs. So while no plain X jobs by 2025, X + AI jobs might be around till 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Things wont be like earlier generations where one skill learnt gets you a job for entire life. One needs to be open to learning new skills and get started in the middle of life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Average level of education needed will be high. Think of it, 50 years back ‚ÄúHigh School‚Äù was all the education needed for most jobs. Now its somewhere between high school and graduation. Masters and Research might look like the next frontier, but these degrees are too slow and broad. Coursera like courses will become more important in catching new skillsets. You might already see people doing that a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With more uncertainty in jobs, millenials probably will want to be a less ‚Äúspend-y‚Äù and more frugal. You can see things happening already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.in/6-reasons-why-more-millennials-arent-buying-homes/articleshow/59005530.cms&quot;&gt;6 reasons why more millennials aren‚Äôt buying homes&lt;/a&gt; and will actually increase. AI is just a trend in a longer cycle of Automation and millenials are at a point in history where education+society was according to old norms but automation has reached a point where jobs have become uncertain. Younger people will be smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;

        &lt;h3 id=&quot;q-why-are-kaggle-grandmasters-in-a-great-demand&quot;&gt;Q. Why are Kaggle Grandmasters in a great demand?&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they work really really hard on Applied Machine Learning (that‚Äôs what kaggle is) and thus have become really good at their job. If there is a hard Machine Learning problem with Billion dollars behind it, with a high probability, Kaggle grandmasters will be able to solve it better than an average joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working consistently on something for years makes one a master of the art. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_\(book\)&quot;&gt;Outliers (book) - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People really good at their job (say in top 10%) are really sought after in any field, not just Machine Learning. They drive the innovation, solve open ended problems and hence they get the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;q-how-do-i-become-a-data-scientist-in-2020-in-india-by-self-teaching&quot;&gt;Q. How do I become a data scientist in 2020 in India by self-teaching?&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally answered the question on Quora here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/TmYc20&quot;&gt;https://qr.ae/TmYc20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think the path to being Data Scientist in India is different from being a Data Scientist abroad. It is in fact 99% same if you live in a place with good internet connectivity and understand English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to clarify to yourself the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;1. As a self-learner, determine if you like learning from books or like learning in virtual classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;2. Either way, you will have to dedicate around 10000 hours of hard work to learning and practical exercises. It looks simple, but most people lose out here. They do not put enough effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;3. Point 2 above requires self drive. It is not easy. A proxy to that is buying online courses / books. The money you put into them makes you (and probably your parents who drive most people towards learning stuff) have skin-in-the-game and you wont want to lose out. If you arent that wealthy, you will have to push yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;4. You have to invest in a good computer. (somewhat 60000 INR cost).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;5. You need to have good internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all. There are enough resources available for free to learn and make yourself a good data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;1. Learn Python programming. This is first and foremost. There are many free books and online courses to learn Python (sometimes Python for Data Science specifically) if you aren‚Äôt enrolling in a course. When you are doing a course or reading a book, don‚Äôt just read it, force yourself into using python after you are done learning. If book exercises look boring to you, join a startup near you as a free intern and do some coding for them. Forcing yourself to write 1000 lines of code (made up number) is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;2. Make yourself comfortable with Python ecosystem : Numpy, Scikit_learn, Keras, PyTorch, Pandas. There are courses and free books available to do these. Look for their ratings on goodreads (for books) and course stars. Best is to just do the famous courses [Applied Data Science with Python&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) , &lt;a href=&quot;http://deeplearning.ai/&quot;&gt;http://deeplearning.ai&lt;/a&gt; and [Machine Learning&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) . If you are looking for free books, check out some lists I curated on ParallelDots blog: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.paralleldots.com/data-science/50-must-read-free-books-for-every-data-science-enthusiast/&quot;&gt;https://blog.paralleldots.com/data-science/50-must-read-free-books-for-every-data-science-enthusiast/&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.paralleldots.com/data-science/24-best-and-free-books-to-understand-machine-learning/&quot;&gt;https://blog.paralleldots.com/data-science/24-best-and-free-books-to-understand-machine-learning/&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.paralleldots.com/data-science/deep-learning/free-resources-deep-learning/&quot;&gt;https://blog.paralleldots.com/data-science/deep-learning/free-resources-deep-learning/&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.paralleldots.com/data-science/nlp/free-natural-language-processing-resources/&quot;&gt;https://blog.paralleldots.com/data-science/nlp/free-natural-language-processing-resources/&lt;/a&gt; . Force yourself to write more and more code. Do problem sets from courses, exercises from books, work for free in a startup, enter analyticsvidhya competitions or whatever suits you. Unless you practice after you learn, its not going to work.&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;3. This much will make you employable by many companies. If you still are trying to push to learn more, you will have to start reading research literature. This is not entirely necessary, but if you still want to, you should get yourself associated with some decent university group (or a research startup), where novel problem statements are being solved. This step is really hard without talking to peers, but if you are really self driven, Twitter is a good place to follow people and handles to learn about research while being outside the research world. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@andreas_madsen/becoming-an-independent-researcher-and-getting-published-in-iclr-with-spotlight-c93ef0b39b8b&quot;&gt;Becoming an Independent Researcher and getting published in ICLR with spotlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally answered here: https://qr.ae/pN28BW&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note : I am assuming that this question was asked to understand ways to judge a potential employer by an applicant who wants to take a job as Data Scientist. What might be something that is risky. There might be other ways to look at it, but this seems most plausible source of the question to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if your company has hired people as Data Scientists, there is definitely a vision to derive value out of data. Funds were allocated, someone actually made effort to hire Data Scientists and (hopefully) a set of problems were defined to solve. If your company is not doing all these 3 (allocation funds, hiring data science team and defining problems to solve), you can safely assume its not going to implement Data Science in near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, something being in the vision is different from getting executed successfully. Sometimes, the company might be looking at Data Science, but there might be some antipatterns in execution that make life of Data Scientists hell and probability of failing high (Similar risks as being a Data Scientist in a company which doesn‚Äôt take Data Science seriously). Execution has its own challenges. Some other issues I see :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not hiring Data Scientists at senior positions and allocating Data Scientists to work under senior technology leaders. Although this might work sometimes, a senior traditional technology executive might take decisions that are not really the best to run a Data Science team. So for example a senior backend developer put in charge of Data Science team will often ask Data Scientists working under him to accommodate additional constraints in the data pipelines they implement. For example, they might be (for no reason) asked to work within the box of software architecture which their lead has designed, reducing their efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sales team not taking feasibility into account is another huge problem. Basically, the Data Science team need not be involved later just in the development of product/service being sold, but also earlier while the sale is being made to make sure something feasible is being sold. They can also suggest applications of data during sales time to make picth better. It is a very common pattern that Sales people of an AI company sell something that is not even feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The third is expecting Data Science teams to work while not having/collecting enough data. This often is a result of 1 or 2 where data wasnt collected to optimize some other tech need, or wrong expectations have been set to any client about the performance a low amount of data can deliver. Data Science is not magic, you need enough data to derive insights or train algorithms on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A spineless leader for Data Science team. Well a spineless leader is always bad as they just pass the pressure downwards. People leave bosses not companies. A lot of the work of senior Data Science folks is expectation management and if they cannot do so, 1,2 and 3 mentioned will haunt the team‚Äôs work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally Answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/After-5-years-of-experience-in-an-irrelevant-field-do-I-have-to-start-as-a-fresher-in-the-AI-field/answer/Muktabh-Mayank&quot;&gt;https://www.quora.com/After-5-years-of-experience-in-an-irrelevant-field-do-I-have-to-start-as-a-fresher-in-the-AI-field/answer/Muktabh-Mayank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs think of it in two different ways :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Do you think that someone who has worked for 5 years in AI will be less or more equipped to solve problems using AI algorithms than someone with 5 years experience in a different domain ? What are the odds of a person not experienced at a domain being better than an experienced person ? What are the odds to a an experienced guitar player playing cello better than an experienced cello player ? There is a very small but non-zero probability, but no one will be willing to take a bet on such small chance. Will you be willing ? Mostly no. That is the point, an unexperienced person is quite a less safe bet than an experienced person . People put less money on less safe bets and more money in safe bets. One doesnt need to start as a fresher if one has no experience in a domain, but one will find it hard to find people who will trust them for the job in lieu of an experienced AI engineer. However, a field is almost always open for entry level employees, so anyone can get started in a field anytime they want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Would you let a person of 5 year experience in AI field and not the field you are working on be willing to hire them as a senior employee in your field ? If you are a backend developer with 5 years experience for example, the AI engineer will almost surely be a worse backend developer than you are. Its only fair that they start working as a junior employee when they join your field despite their experience. I hope you can imagine why the opposite will be true as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-if-i-have-a-bca-degree-how-can-i-become-a-successful-data-scientist-in-india&quot;&gt;Q. If I have a BCA degree, how can I become a successful data scientist in India?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question has hidden context which is not directly visible to someone trying to answer it. I will have to break it down as two possible states you might be in while asking this question, read accordingly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. &lt;strong&gt;Your curriculum hasn‚Äôt got enough Data Science/Mathematics/Machine Learning theory and you want to cover these subjects:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;It has now become very easy to access quality Data Science courses and lectures if you are self driven. Join a course specialization on coursera, edx, deeplearning ai or fast ai and push yourself to complete the course well, not just to pass tests. If you have some money, you can buy certifications, else audit these courses for free. Read good Data Science and Machine Learning books (Listed here: [50 Must-Read Free Books For Every Data Scientist in 2020&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;ParallelDots](https://blog.paralleldots.com/data-science/50-must-read-free-books-for-every-data-science-enthusiast/)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;

  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;and [24 Best (and Free) Books To Understand Machine Learning&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;ParallelDots](https://blog.paralleldots.com/data-science/24-best-and-free-books-to-understand-machine-learning/)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;) and try solving exercises from these courses and books. Make sure you work on practical problems, not plain theory. Data Science is and continues to be very empirical field and practical knowledge is very important. These courses/books give you enough knowledge about any potential entry level Data Science jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. &lt;strong&gt;You think you know Data Science well enough to work in a firm but BCA degree is not providing you enough credential to get a job:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second possible scenario I can think you have asked the question in. This is actually a hard scenario and can be thought to be like a Chicken Egg problem. ‚ÄúJust BCA doesnt get you a Data Science job‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Data Science job experience is required to make your CV credentialed enough to make your degree unimportant‚Äù, this is a loop. There is just one way to break out of Chicken Egg loops, put an asymmetric proposition on table. Offer to work for free or for minimal money with Universities/Companies which can get you a good project and a credential on your CV. Look for CS professors working on AI in an IIT/NIT/IIIT near you and ask them if they have any internship projects. Invest 1 or 2 quarters till you have a CV which is not limited by the scope of your degree and you are now good to go for any job applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Machine Learning Jobs for beginners/freshers : My Perspective from various Quora Answers</summary></entry></feed>
